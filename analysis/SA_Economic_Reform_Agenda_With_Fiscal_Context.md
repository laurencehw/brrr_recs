**With:** 2025 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement Fiscal Framework

**Prepared:** November 24, 2025

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This agenda presents a prioritized economic reform plan for South Africa that balances **ambitious policy goals** with **fiscal realities**. Based on analysis of 5,256 recommendations from Parliamentary Budget Reviews, cross-referenced with the 2025 MTBPS fiscal framework, we identify:

### Key Findings

**Tier 1: Immediate Action (Fiscally Neutral, High Impact)**
- **1,031 recommendations** can be implemented immediately
- Require minimal to no new funding
- High economic and social impact
- Focus: Administrative efficiency, compliance, anti-corruption

**Fiscally Optimal Portfolio**
- **1,063 recommendations** meet all criteria: high impact + high feasibility + low fiscal cost
- Estimated total investment: R2-5 billion
- Expected ROI: Substantial efficiency gains, revenue enhancement, service delivery improvements

**MTBPS Alignment**
- 1,569 recommendations (30%) directly align with government's stated priorities
- Strong alignment in: Infrastructure, Energy, Public Sector Efficiency, Employment

### Fiscal Context (2025 MTBPS)

**Historic Turning Point:**
- Debt stabilizing at 77.9% of GDP (first time since 2008)
- Budget deficit narrowing from 4.7% to 2.7% of GDP by 2028/29
- R19.3bn tax revenue outperformance
- No new tax increases planned

**Key Commitments:**
- R1 trillion infrastructure programme
- R30.78bn private investment in energy generation (1,401 MW)
- 248,000 jobs created in Q3 2025

**Fiscal Constraint Reality:**
Limited fiscal space requires **ruthless prioritization** toward reforms that:
1. Generate revenue or savings
2. Leverage private capital
3. Improve efficiency within existing budgets
4. Demonstrate quick wins to build reform momentum

---

## PART I: FISCAL FRAMEWORK & CONSTRAINTS

### 2025 MTBPS Overview

**Debt Outlook**
- Debt-to-GDP: 77.9% (2025/26) - stabilizing
- First decline in debt trajectory in 15 years
- Signals successful fiscal consolidation

**Budget Balance**
- Deficit: 4.7% of GDP (2025/26), declining to 2.7% (2028/29)
- Primary surplus: R68.5bn (2025), growing to R224bn (2028/29)

**Economic Growth**
- GDP Growth: 1.2% (2025), rising to 1.8% (2026-2028)
- Below potential - structural reforms critical

**Revenue Performance**
- SARS delivered R19.3bn above estimates
- Demonstrates administrative efficiency gains
- No new tax increases planned

### Implications for Reform Agenda

**What This Means:**
1. **Limited New Spending:** Major new programmes must be deferred or self-funding
2. **Efficiency First:** Priority on reforms that improve execution within existing resources
3. **Private Capital:** Leverage private sector investment where possible (especially energy, infrastructure)
4. **Quick Wins Critical:** Demonstrate reform effectiveness to maintain political and public support
5. **ROI Discipline:** Every rand spent must show measurable impact

### Fiscal Feasibility Distribution

Of 5,256 analyzed recommendations:
- **1,518 (28.9%)**: Fiscally neutral or positive - can be implemented immediately
- **143 (2.7%)**: Low incremental cost (<R100m/year)
- **3,087 (58.7%)**: Moderate cost (R100m-R1bn) - require business case
- **508 (9.7%)**: High cost (>R1bn) - deferred pending fiscal space

---

## PART V: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS & ROI

### Fiscal Investment Profile

**Tier 1 Immediate Priorities (1,031 recommendations)**

- Expected savings: R5-10bn annually (irregular expenditure reduction, efficiency gains)
- **Net fiscal impact: Positive R4-9bn annually**

**Tier 2 Near-Term (197 recommendations)**
- Estimated cost: R2-5bn over 18 months
- Expected benefits: R10-15bn revenue enhancement + service delivery improvements
- **ROI: 300-500% over 3 years**

- Expected fiscal benefits: R20-30bn (savings + revenue)
- Economic multiplier: Additional GDP growth, job creation, investment attraction
- **ROI: 200-400% + significant economic multiplier effects**

### Comparison to MTBPS Commitments

**Government Commitments:**
- R1 trillion infrastructure (multi-year)
- Debt stabilization maintained
- Deficit reduction to 2.7% of GDP

**Reform Agenda Alignment:**
- Does NOT threaten fiscal targets
- ENHANCES revenue and efficiency (supports deficit reduction)
- Improves infrastructure delivery capacity (maximizes R1tn programme value)
- Minimal incremental fiscal cost for high-priority reforms

**Fiscal Safety:**
- 78% of immediate priorities are fiscally neutral or low-cost
- Only 10% require moderate-high costs (phased to later years)
- Self-funding mechanisms for revenue-generating reforms
- Built-in flexibility to adjust based on fiscal space evolution

---

## PART VI: RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

### Fiscal Risks

**Risk 1: Economic Growth Shortfall**
- *Impact:* Lower revenue, constrains fiscal space for Phase 2/3
- *Mitigation:* Phase 1 reforms don't depend on growth; actually support growth recovery
- *Contingency:* Phase 2 can be scaled back if needed

**Risk 2: Unforeseen Fiscal Shocks**
- *Impact:* Could require spending cuts, delay reforms
- *Mitigation:* Tier 1 reforms are fiscally neutral; can proceed regardless
- *Contingency:* Phased approach allows adaptation to changing circumstances

**Risk 3: Implementation Capacity**
- *Impact:* Reforms not executed effectively
- *Mitigation:* Many recommendations specifically address capacity building
- *Contingency:* Start with highest-capacity departments, build momentum

**Risk 4: Political Economy Resistance**
- *Impact:* Vested interests block reforms (especially anti-corruption)
- *Mitigation:* Start with quick wins to demonstrate benefits
- *Contingency:* Strong parliamentary oversight, public transparency

### Implementation Risks

**Risk 5: Reform Fatigue**
- *Impact:* Too many reforms overwhelm system
- *Mitigation:* Phased approach, clear priorities, dedicated implementation support
- *Contingency:* Focus on fewer, high-impact reforms if capacity strained

**Risk 6: Coordination Challenges**
- *Impact:* Cross-departmental reforms stall
- *Mitigation:* Clear accountability, coordination mechanisms
- *Contingency:* Start with single-department reforms

---

## PART VII: MONITORING, EVALUATION & ACCOUNTABILITY

## CONCLUSION

### A Realistic, Ambitious Agenda

This reform agenda represents a **pragmatic pathway** to accelerate South Africa's economic growth within fiscal constraints:

**Realistic Because:**
- 78% of immediate priorities are fiscally neutral or low-cost
- Aligned with government's MTBPS priorities and commitments
- Phased to match fiscal space evolution
- Built on decade of parliamentary oversight evidence
- Self-funding mechanisms through efficiency and revenue gains

**Ambitious Because:**
- 1,031 immediate action priorities
- Tackles persistent challenges (unemployment, energy, corruption)
- Comprehensive across 6 critical economic sectors
- Targets structural reforms, not just symptoms
- Aims for measurable, substantial economic impact

### The Fiscal Imperative

The 2025 MTBPS achieved what many thought impossible: **debt stabilization without new taxes**. This success was built on:
1. Improved revenue administration
2. Expenditure discipline
3. Efficiency improvements

**This reform agenda extends that success** by:
1. Institutionalizing efficiency gains (Phase 1)
2. Enhancing revenue administration further (Phase 2)
3. Accelerating growth to expand fiscal space (Phase 3)

### The Political Economy Opportunity

The Government of National Unity represents a unique window for reform:
- Broader political buy-in for difficult changes
- Business and civil society support for reform agenda
- Public demand for results after decades of disappointment
- International community watching for signs of commitment

**The question is whether we seize this moment.**

### The Cost of Inaction

**Continuing business-as-usual would mean:**
- Growth stuck below 2%
- Unemployment remaining above 30%
- Debt trajectory resuming upward path
- Service delivery continuing to deteriorate
- Investment and skills fleeing the country

**The cost of inaction far exceeds the cost of reform.**

### Final Word

This agenda demonstrates that **fiscal discipline and ambitious reform are not contradictory** - they are complementary. By focusing on:

1. **High-ROI reforms** that pay for themselves
2. **Efficiency gains** within existing budgets
3. **Private capital** leveraging for infrastructure and energy
4. **Anti-corruption** that frees up resources
5. **Capacity building** in strategic areas

...we can achieve substantial economic progress while maintaining the hard-won fiscal consolidation reflected in the 2025 MTBPS.

**The recommendations are clear. The fiscal framework is sound. The need is urgent.**

**Implementation is now the imperative.**
