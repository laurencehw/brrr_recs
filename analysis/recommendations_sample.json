The National Planning Commission, which was appointed by the former President J Zuma in May 2010 developed the National Development Plan whose aim is to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality by 2030. In its diagnostic report of June 2011, the Commission identified unemployment as one of the nine primary challenges confronting the country. Therefore, raising employment through faster economic growth became one of the three priorities to remedy the situation the country finds itself in. One of the key points raised in the National Development Plan was, \u201cTo eliminate poverty and reduce inequality, South Africa has to raise levels of employment and, through productivity growth, the earnings of working people.\u201d The key measures of economic success were identified as achieving an average growth of over 5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the reduction in unemployment rate to 6% by 2030.

Since more jobs were created than lost, the explanation for an increase in unemployment rate can be attributed to the increase in the number of people entering the job market as reflected by the reduction in the \u201cnot economically active\u201d population, which decreased by 326 000 quarter-to-quarter. In response to the unemployment challenge, President Ramaphosa convened the Presidential Job Summit, which developed the Framework Agreement in October 2018. Social partners who were part of the summit agreed that the unemployment crisis necessitated the Jobs Summit to focus not only on job creation but also address the crisis of job losses and retrenchments. Government dismissed the rumour that it was going to embark on retrenchments in the Public Service and committed to filling all critical vacancies in the Public Sector. Business agreed that everything possible had to be done to avoid retrenchments in the Private Sector. The Jobs Summit identified five areas of interventions to realise intended outcomes, which are: Economic sector specific Interventions; SMME interventions; Education and Skills interventions; Inclusive growth interventions; and Public and Social interventions. Furthermore, the social partners agreed on continuous monitoring of implementation of commitments. In 2018 Parliament processed and passed the National Minimum Wage Act whose purpose is, inter alia, to improve the wages of lowest paid workers. This will contribute in narrowing the income inequality gap and improve lives of those who were earning less than the prescribed national minimum wage. While the introduction of the national minimum wage was met with some criticism regarding the level at which it was introduced, it was estimated that about six million workers stood to benefit from its introduction. The triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality have persisted despite legislative interventions that started in 1994. This, amongst others, prompted the fourth democratic parliament to identify assessment of the impact of legislation passed since 1994 as key priority to be undertaken by the fifth democratic parliament. The High Level Panel that was headed by former President K Motlanthe was appointed by the fifth Parliament to conduct the impact assessment of the legislation and make recommendations. The panel produced a report titled: \u201cReport of the High Level Panel on the Assessment of Key Legislation and the Acceleration of Fundamental Change\u201d.
