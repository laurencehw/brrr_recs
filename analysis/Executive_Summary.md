# SOUTH AFRICAN ECONOMIC REFORM AGENDA – EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (GROWTH LENS)

**Dataset:** 5,256 BRRR recommendations (2015–2025)  
**Cleaned & deduped:** Yes  
**Scoring:** Feasibility, Impact, Cost, ROI + Growth Priority overlay  
**Date:** November 24, 2025

## Key Numbers
- Quick Wins (high impact/feasibility, low cost): 441  
- High Priority (strong scores overall): 2,060  
- Top Growth-Priority Set (after constraint/fiscal overlay): 200 (see `Top Growth Priorities` sheet)  
- Binding constraints tagged: energy; logistics/ports/rail; water/sanitation; permits/licences; skills/visas; municipal collapse; crime/corruption; competition/entry; digital connectivity.

## Top 12 Actionable Priorities (0–18 months)
1) Energy – Grid access & wheeling fast-lane (DMRE/NERSA/PTSO, 0–6m, private-funded)  
2) Energy – Metro distribution loss clampdown (INEP/MIG conditionality, 6–18m, savings)  
3) Logistics – Port/rail recovery with private ops & slot auctions (Transnet/DTIC/NT, 0–12m)  
4) Permits – 90-day one-stop approvals for major projects (Presidency/DTIC/DWS, 0–6m)  
5) Skills/Visas – 30-day critical-skills lane (DHA/DTIC, 0–6m)  
6) Municipal – Enforce grant conditionality; redirect on underspend (NT/CoGTA, 0–12m)  
7) Procurement – Clamp down on deviations/expansions; SIU/NPA fast-lane (0–12m, savings)  
8) Competition – Implement market-inquiry remedies (CompCom/DTIC, 0–12m, price relief)  
9) Digital – Enforce spectrum/open-access obligations; unblock wayleaves (ICASA/DTPS, 0–12m)  
10) Water – Non-revenue-water strike teams in top-20 metros (6–18m, savings)  
11) Public Capex – Scale project-prep facility for R1tn pipeline (NT/GTAC, 0–12m)  
12) Revenue Admin – Close customs/PIT/CIT compliance gaps (SARS, 0–12m, revenue+)

## Fiscal Alignment (MTBPS)
- Phase 1 (0–6m): neutral/savings; focuses on admin/process fixes and leakage reduction.  
- Phase 2 (6–18m): low-cost enablers funded by reprioritisation/conditional grants.  
- Phase 3 (18–36m): capital via private/PPP; minimal new public spend.  
- Debt stabilising at ~77.9% GDP; deficit 4.7% → 2.7%; no new taxes → strict ROI discipline.

## Monitoring (headline)
- Load-shedding hours; MW connected; wheeling approvals.  
- Port dwell/berth times; rail tonnage vs capacity.  
- Visa approval days; backlog.  
- MIG/INEP/WSIG spend %; non-revenue water %; distribution losses %.  
- Procurement deviations (count/value); irregular-expenditure trend.  
- Food basket and transport cost indices; youth unemployment.
