## Budgetary Framework for Economic Reform Recommendations

**Source:** National Treasury Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, October 2025

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The 2025 MTBPS represents a **historic turning point** in South Africa's fiscal trajectory:

- **First debt stabilization since 2008**: Debt-to-GDP peaks at 77.9% in 2025/26 before declining
- **Improved fiscal position**: Budget deficit narrows from 4.7% to 2.7% of GDP by 2028/29
- **Tax revenue outperformance**: SARS collected R19.3bn above estimates
- **No new tax increases**: Fiscal consolidation achieved through improved collection and expenditure management

**Key Implication for Reform Agenda:** Limited new fiscal space requires prioritization of high-ROI, efficiency-enhancing reforms that can be funded within existing allocations or generate revenue/savings.

## FISCAL CONSTRAINTS & PRESSURES

### 1. **Limited Fiscal Space**
- Despite improved outlook, government faces spending ceilings
- New initiatives must be funded through reprioritization or efficiency gains
- No appetite for tax increases given economic growth constraints

### 2. **Debt Service Costs**
- Debt service costs remain elevated despite stabilization
- Interest payments consume significant portion of revenue
- Constrains ability to increase spending in other areas

### 3. **Wage Bill Pressures**
- Government wage bill remains major expenditure item
- Balancing fiscal consolidation with filling critical vacancies
- Public sector productivity improvements essential

### 4. **State-Owned Enterprise Contingent Liabilities**
- SOE financial health remains fiscal risk
- Government support must be balanced with fiscal sustainability
- Reform and operational efficiency improvements non-negotiable

### 5. **Social Spending Commitments**
- Social grants and basic services are protected
- Must maintain social safety net while pursuing fiscal consolidation
- Efficiency in service delivery critical to maintain spending levels

## IMPLICATIONS FOR REFORM AGENDA

### Priority Recommendations (Fiscally Feasible)

Given fiscal constraints, the reform agenda should emphasize:

1. **"Quick Wins" - Fiscally Neutral Reforms**
   - 441 identified recommendations with low cost and high feasibility
   - Focus on administrative efficiency, compliance, process improvements
   - Can demonstrate reform momentum without fiscal strain

2. **Revenue/Savings Generating Reforms**
   - Irregular expenditure reduction (R221 recommendations across sectors)
   - Budget execution improvements (R616 recommendations)
   - Procurement efficiency (R248 recommendations)
   - Can self-fund or create fiscal space for other priorities

3. **Private Capital Leveraging**
   - Energy sector private investment enablement
   - Infrastructure PPPs
   - SME ecosystem support (regulatory, not financial)
   - Aligns with R1 trillion infrastructure commitment

4. **High-ROI Capacity Building**
   - Filling critical vacancies (246 recommendations)
   - Skills development in bottleneck areas
   - Targeted rather than broad-based expansion

### Sequencing Approach

**Phase 1 (0-6 months): Zero/Low Fiscal Cost**
- Administrative reforms
- Process improvements
- Compliance enhancements
- Anti-corruption measures

**Phase 2 (6-18 months): Revenue-Generating & Moderate Cost**
- Efficiency-driven reforms
- Targeted capacity building
- Revenue administration improvements
- Pilot programmes for larger reforms

**Phase 3 (18-36 months): Structural Reforms**
- Infrastructure scaling (with private capital)
- Major institutional reforms
- Large-scale programmes (as fiscal space emerges)

## MONITORING: FISCAL & ECONOMIC IMPACT

### Key Metrics to Track

**Fiscal Health Indicators:**
- Budget deficit trajectory (target: 2.7% by 2028/29)
- Debt-to-GDP ratio (maintain stabilization)
- Revenue collection performance
- Irregular/wasteful expenditure trends

**Economic Growth Indicators:**
- GDP growth (target: >2% sustainably)
- Employment levels and unemployment rate
- Private sector investment (especially energy)
- Business confidence indices

**Reform Implementation Indicators:**
- Quick wins completion rate
- Budget execution rates by department
- Auditor-General outcomes
- Service delivery metrics

---

## CONCLUSION

The 2025 MTBPS provides both **constraints and opportunities**:

**Constraints:**
- Limited fiscal space for new major spending
- Need to maintain fiscal consolidation path
- Debt stabilization must be preserved

**Opportunities:**
- Improved revenue collection creates modest room for reprioritization
- Strong focus on infrastructure investment
- Political will for efficiency and reform
- Private sector capital available (especially energy)

**Strategic Implication:**
The reform agenda must be **ruthlessly prioritized** toward:
1. High-impact, low-cost administrative reforms
2. Revenue/savings generating measures
3. Private capital leveraging
4. Targeted capacity building in strategic areas

This fiscal discipline actually **strengthens the reform agenda** by forcing focus on highest-ROI interventions and demonstrable results.
