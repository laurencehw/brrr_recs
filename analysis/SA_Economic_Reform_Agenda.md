## PART V: RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS & COST ESTIMATES

### Budget Classification

Based on analysis of recommendation text and implementation requirements:

- **Very Expensive (>R1bn)**: 895 recommendations (17.0%)
- **Expensive (R100m-R1bn)**: 76 recommendations (1.4%)
- **Moderate (R10m-R100m)**: 3241 recommendations (61.7%)
- **Low (R1m-R10m)**: 191 recommendations (3.6%)
- **Minimal (<R1m)**: 853 recommendations (16.2%)


### Quick Win Investment Profile

Of the 441 Quick Win recommendations:
- **380 require minimal funding** (<R1m each)
- **61 require low funding** (R1m-R10m each)
- **441 require moderate or less** (<R100m each)

**Estimated Total Investment for Quick Wins Portfolio:** R500m - R1.5bn
**Expected Economic Impact:** Significant improvement in government efficiency, service delivery, and business confidence

## PART VI: MONITORING & ACCOUNTABILITY

### Success Metrics

**Governance & Efficiency**
- Reduction in irregular/wasteful expenditure
- Improvement in budget execution rates

**Economic Impact**
- Job creation (formal sector employment growth)
- SME growth and survival rates
- Foreign and domestic investment levels
- Energy availability (reduction in load shedding hours)

**Service Delivery**
- Infrastructure backlog reduction
- Service delivery target achievement
- Public satisfaction indices
- Time-to-delivery improvements

### Accountability Framework

1. **Quarterly Progress Reports** to Parliament on implementation status
2. **Independent Monitoring** through established oversight mechanisms
3. **Public Dashboard** tracking key reform metrics
4. **Annual Review** with course corrections as needed

---

## CONCLUSION

This reform agenda is based on a decade of parliamentary oversight findings, representing the collective insights of portfolio committees across critical economic sectors. The recommendations prioritize:

1. **Evidence-Based Policy:** Drawn from systematic analysis of actual budget execution and sectoral performance
2. **Feasibility:** Focused on achievable reforms that can demonstrate near-term impact
3. **ROI-Driven:** Prioritizing actions that deliver maximum economic benefit relative to implementation effort
4. **Institutional Sustainability:** Addressing root causes rather than symptoms

The 441 identified Quick Wins alone represent a substantial reform agenda that can be launched immediately to build momentum, demonstrate government effectiveness, and restore business and public confidence in South Africa's economic management.

**The question is not whether we can afford to implement these reforms—it is whether we can afford not to.**
