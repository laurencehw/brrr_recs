The National Planning Commission, which was appointed by the former President J Zuma in May 2010 developed the National Development Plan whose aim is to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality by 2030. In its diagnostic report of June 2011, the Commission identified unemployment as one of the nine primary challenges confronting the country. Therefore, raising employment through faster economic growth became one of the three priorities to remedy the situation the country finds itself in. One of the key points raised in the National Development Plan was, “To eliminate poverty and reduce inequality, South Africa has to raise levels of employment and, through productivity growth, the earnings of working people.” The key measures of economic success were identified as achieving an average growth of over 5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the reduction in unemployment rate to 6% by 2030. The Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS), which is a household- based sample survey conducted by Statistics South Africa, reported the unemployment rate to be 29% at the end of June 2019 (Quarter",

Since more jobs were created than lost, the explanation for an increase in unemployment rate can be attributed to the increase in the number of people entering the job market as reflected by the reduction in the “not economically active” population, which decreased by 326 000 quarter-to-quarter. In response to the unemployment challenge, President Ramaphosa convened the Presidential Job Summit, which developed the Framework Agreement in October 2018. Social partners who were part of the summit agreed that the unemployment crisis necessitated the Jobs Summit to focus not only on job creation but also address the crisis of job losses and retrenchments. Government dismissed the rumour that it was going to embark on retrenchments in the Public Service and committed to filling all critical vacancies in the Public Sector. Business agreed that everything possible had to be done to avoid retrenchments in the Private Sector. The Jobs Summit identified five areas of interventions to realise intended outcomes, which are: Economic sector specific Interventions; SMME interventions; Education and Skills interventions; Inclusive growth interventions; and Public and Social interventions. Furthermore, the social partners agreed on continuous monitoring of implementation of commitments. In 2018 Parliament processed and passed the National Minimum Wage Act whose purpose is, inter alia, to improve the wages of lowest paid workers. This will contribute in narrowing the income inequality gap and improve lives of those who were earning less than the prescribed national minimum wage. While the introduction of the national minimum wage was met with some criticism regarding the level at which it was introduced, it was estimated that about six million workers stood to benefit from its introduction. The triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality have persisted despite legislative interventions that started in 1994. This, amongst others, prompted the fourth democratic parliament to identify assessment of the impact of legislation passed since 1994 as key priority to be undertaken by the fifth democratic parliament. The High Level Panel that was headed by former President K Motlanthe was appointed by the fifth Parliament to conduct the impact assessment of the legislation and make recommendations. The panel produced a report titled: “Report of the High Level Panel on the Assessment of Key Legislation and the Acceleration of Fundamental Change”. The panel recommended, amongst others,",

Response: The Employee Relations process deals with all the officials who are found to be liable through the recovery process or other forms of disciplinary process. 3.1.4 The Inspection and Enforcement Services programme is adequately resourced so that suitably qualified inspectors can be appointed; provided with relevant tools of trade to monitor implementation of labour laws and that the retainment strategy is developed. Response: The Branch is going to add 500 more OHS inspectors by the end of the financial year. The Branch has put in place various strategies to ensure retention of staff. The Departmental policy on retention is also utilised to assist with this. 3.1.5. The funding of Productivity SA is timeously addressed in line with the proposed single funder mechanism to enable the entity to fulfil its mandate.

Fifty per cent of employment and labour portfolio received unqualified audit opinion with findings. DEL materially underspent the budget by R196,2 million primarily on programme 1 and 3, due to vacancies and delays in capital project expenditure. The Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE) and UIF received qualified audit opinion with findings in 2018/19 financial year, constituting 33% of the employment and labour portfolio. Both SEE and UIF had received unqualified audit opinion with findings in 2017/18 financial year. SEE had received a qualified opinion in 2016/17 and the UIF received a disclaimer in the same financial year. The Compensation Fund (CF) received a disclaimer of opinion in 2018/19 financial year, which is the worst audit opinion. The CF had received a disclaimer of opinion since 2014/15 financial year. AGSA reported that DEL achieved unqualified opinions because they corrected all misstatements identified during the audit. Qualification areas for CF and UIF regarded unlisted investments where credibility of data in respect of valuations performed could not be validated for completeness and accuracy. AGSA further reported that another qualification area for CF was the limitations on revenue and claims. Furthermore, it reported that cost of sales were inaccurately recorded and inventories were valued at an incorrect amount at SEE. With regard to credible performance reporting, Nedlac and UIF submitted performance reports without errors. This constitute 33% of performance reports submitted without errors, which is an improvement from the 17% of reports without errors in 2017/18.

This constitutes 67% of reliable reporting of achievements, which is an improvement from the 50% in the previous financial year. Performance indicators and targets of the SEE were reported to be useful.

By the end of June, the Department had spent R758. 6 million or 22.1% of the total budget. This is lower than the projected amount of R830.7 million by R72.1 million or 8.7%. The slow spending is mainly under compensation of employees, goods and services and payments for capital assets. 6.2. Expenditure per programme 6.2.1. Administration The Administration programme was appropriated R962.0 million and had spent R182.5 million or 19.0% of the allocation by the end of the first quarter. This is R49.0 million or 21.2% less than the projected expenditure of R231.5 million. The slow spending is mainly under compensation of employees due to vacant finance, supply chain, security and management posts at provincial offices and labour centres and IT posts at head office. The slow spending on goods and services is due to delays in invoicing by service providers for the procurement of cars for the departmental fleet in the provinces as well as delays in the issuing of invoices for office accommodation leases and municipal service charge by the Department of Public Works. 6.2.2. Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) The main appropriation for Inspection and Enforcement Services programme was R631.1 million and the programme had spent R126.2 million or 20.0% by the end of the first quarter. This is R200 000 or 0.1% higher than the projected R126.0 million. Goods and Services was the main contributor to higher spending. This is due to new security services tender that came into effect in April",

Public Employment Services (PES) The main appropriation for Public Employment Services programme was R611.2 million and R145.6 million or 23.8% was spent by the end of the first quarter. This is R10.0 million or 6.4% less than the projected expenditure of R155.6 million. The slow spending was mainly under transfers and subsidies because of delays in the payment of transfers to Designated Groups Special Services due to the adjudication committee approving the awarding of funding, which was completed on 23 July 2019. 6.2.4. Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) The main appropriation for Labour Policy and Industrial Relations programme was R1.2 billion and the programme had spent R304.3 million or 24.7% of the allocation by the end of the first quarter. This is R13.2 million or 4.2% less than the projected R317.5 million expenditure. The slow spending is mainly under compensation of employees due to delays in establishing and appointing the National Minimum Wage Commission. Slow spending under goods and services is due to delayed invoicing for property payments as well as delayed invoicing by service providers for the procurement of cars for the regional offices. The slow spending under transfers and subsidies is due to delays in transferring funds to Strengthen Civil Society because of late submission of signed original memoranda of agreements. Most of these memorandums of agreements were only received in June. 6.3. Personnel Expenditure on compensation of employees during the first quarter was R300.8 million or 21.5% of the available budget of R1.4 billion, against the projected spend of R319.6 million as at the end of June 2019. The headcount target for 2019/20 as per the Estimates of National Expenditure is 3 341 with only 2 690 posts filled by the end of the first quarter. The slow spending and lower headcount is due to delays in the filling of vacant posts. 6.4. Issues for the Committee to note The Department is struggling to retain labour inspectors. Many labour inspectors leave the Department for higher salaries in the private sector and departments such as Mineral Resources. The Department needs to develop a strategy to retain inspectors within the IES in consultation with the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA).",

As a corrective measure, the technical indicator has been amended to reflect ‘all’ cases activated for conciliation at first event within 30 days of the date of receipt of referral.

However, it scored zero in programme 2, which is Human Resource Management and programme 6, which is Turnaround Solutions. The entity had four annual planned indicators for programme 5, which is value chain competitiveness. It achieved two of those indicators translating to an overall achievement of 50%. It is concerning that the entity scored a zero on turnaround solutions programme, which is its core function. This may be attributed to the fact that the grants from UIF towards this programme are not guaranteed and the transfers are always not in full or on time, which resulted in the programme being suspended during the 2018/19 financial year. The reason for poor performance of the entity on core functions is elaborated upon below. 8.4.4. Productivity SA Challenges Productivity SA current funding model does not allow the organisation to adequately achieve its national mandate of leading and inspiring a competitive and productive South Africa. The organisation is also under-resourced in terms of human capacity and the lack of required resources hinders its ability to make a meaningful and desirable impact nationwide. The current challenges emanate from the change in business environment with the promulgation of the Employment Services Act in 2015, which expanded the mandate of Productivity SA to include promoting employment growth and supporting initiatives aimed at preventing job losses. However, there was no additional funding appropriated by Parliament for this expanded mandate. Productivity SA is a national public entity, but its footprint is limited to three provinces resulting in inadequate national coverage and equitable servicing of all the nine provinces. The footprint is reorganised into regional offices (Johannesburg/ Midrand servicing Gauteng, North West and Limpopo; eThekwini/ Durban servicing KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga; and Cape Town servicing the Western Cape, Free State and the Northern Cape). The Funds received from the three sources of funding i.e. DEL, DTI and the UIF are not sufficient for the entity to deliver on its mandate and provide services to the entire country. The persistent applications for additional funds are evidence of the funding problem. 8.4.5. Annual financial performance of Productivity SA as at",

The Fund planned to reduce the vacancy rate to 10% or less but it was at 13.3% (80 vacancies/602 establishment) by 31 March 2019. Failure to meet the target was attributed to high volumes of applications received and the recruitment and selection of 68 internship posts additional to the establishment.

COMMITTEE OBSERVATIONS After considering the presentations made by the Department and its entities on their annual reports and the input from the Auditor- General and Advisory Boards, the Committee made the following observations: 9.1. Department of Employment and Labour (DEL) 9.1.1 South Africa's official unemployment rate soared to 29 percent in the second quarter of the year, the highest jobless rate since the start of 2008. 9.1.2 The Department materially underspent the allocated budget by R196.2 million. Effective and appropriate steps were not taken to prevent wasteful, irregular and fruitless expenditure. 9.1.3 Most challenges identified by AGSA in the department had already been identified by internal auditors. However, the department was slow to implement recommendations from internal audit. 9.1.4 The main reason for variance between appropriated funds and expenditure was reported to be the vacancies in the Department that resulted in underspending on Compensation of Employees. 9.1.5 Inspection and Enforcement Services programme has been struggling to attract and retain labour inspectors for the past few years. Many labour inspectors leave the Department for higher salaries in the private sector and to departments such as the Department of Mineral Resources. 9.1.6 With the expanded mandate on Employment, the DEL will require budget allocation increase to create an enabling environment for job creation. 9.1.7 The National Treasury reported that the headcount target for the Department was 3 341 personnel but only 2 690 posts were filled by the end of the first quarter. This translates to 651 vacant posts by the end of the first quarter. 9.2. Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE) 9.2.1 SEE generates its income from the sales of manufactured goods that include furniture, hospital linen, protective clothing, garments, upholstery and screen printing, therefore, requires more government departments to procure from their products in order to be sustainable as an entity. 9.3. Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) 9.3.1 CCMA has additional statutory obligations in terms of the National Minimum Wage, Basic Conditions of Employment Act and Labour Relations Act, which will require additional funding to enable it to fully implement legislation. 9.4. Productivity South Africa (PSA) 9.4.1 PSA continues to experience funding challenges, which led to the suspension of the Turnaround Solutions programme.",

DEL and CCMA had been receiving unqualified audit opinion with findings since 2014/15 financial year. Fifty per cent of employment and labour portfolio received unqualified audit opinion with findings. DEL materially underspent the budget by R196,2 million primarily on programme 1 and 3, due to vacancies and delays in capital project expenditure. The Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE) and UIF received qualified audit opinion with findings in 2018/19 financial year, constituting 33% of the employment and labour portfolio. Both SEE and UIF had received unqualified audit opinion with findings in 2017/18 financial year. SEE had received a qualified opinion in 2016/17 and the UIF received a disclaimer in the same financial year. The Compensation Fund (CF) received a disclaimer of opinion in 2018/19 financial year, which is the worst audit opinion. The CF had received a disclaimer of opinion since 2014/15 financial year. AGSA reported that DEL achieved unqualified opinions because they corrected all misstatements identified during the audit. Qualification areas for CF and UIF regarded unlisted investments where credibility of data in respect of valuations performed could not be validated for completeness and accuracy. AGSA further reported that another qualification area for CF was the limitations on revenue and claims. Furthermore, it reported that cost of sales were inaccurately recorded and inventories were valued at an incorrect amount at SEE. With regard to credible performance reporting, Nedlac and UIF submitted performance reports without errors. This constitute 33% of performance reports submitted without errors, which is an improvement from the 17% of reports without errors in 2017/18. DEL, CF, CCMA and SEE were reported to have submitted reliable reporting of achievements. This constitutes 67% of reliable reporting of achievements, which is an improvement from the 50% in the previous financial year. Performance indicators and targets of the SEE were reported to be useful. AGSA reported material findings on compliance with key legislation for DEL, CF, Nedlac, SEE and UIF in 2018/19 financial year. Only the CCMA had no material findings in the year under review.

The slow spending is mainly under compensation of employees, goods and services and payments for capital assets. 6.2. Expenditure per programme 6.2.1. Administration The Administration programme was appropriated R962.0 million and had spent R182.5 million or 19.0% of the allocation by the end of the first quarter. This is R49.0 million or 21.2% less than the projected expenditure of R231.5 million. The slow spending is mainly under compensation of employees due to vacant finance, supply chain, security and management posts at provincial offices and labour centres and IT posts at head office. The slow spending on goods and services is due to delays in invoicing by service providers for the procurement of cars for the departmental fleet in the provinces as well as delays in the issuing of invoices for office accommodation leases and municipal service charge by the Department of Public Works. 6.2.2. Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) The main appropriation for Inspection and Enforcement Services programme was R631.1 million and the programme had spent R126.2 million or 20.0% by the end of the first quarter.

This is R10.0 million or 6.4% less than the projected expenditure of R155.6 million. The slow spending was mainly under transfers and subsidies because of delays in the payment of transfers to Designated Groups Special Services due to the adjudication committee approving the awarding of funding, which was completed on 23 July 2019. 6.2.4. Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) The main appropriation for Labour Policy and Industrial Relations programme was R1.2 billion and the programme had spent R304.3 million or 24.7% of the allocation by the end of the first quarter. This is R13.2 million or 4.2% less than the projected R317.5 million expenditure. The slow spending is mainly under compensation of employees due to delays in establishing and appointing the National Minimum Wage Commission. Slow spending under goods and services is due to delayed invoicing for property payments as well as delayed invoicing by service providers for the procurement of cars for the regional offices. The slow spending under transfers and subsidies is due to delays in transferring funds to Strengthen Civil Society because of late submission of signed original memoranda of agreements.

The headcount target for 2019/20 as per the Estimates of National Expenditure is 3 341 with only 2 690 posts filled by the end of the first quarter. The slow spending and lower headcount is due to delays in the filling of vacant posts. 6.4. Issues for the Committee to note The Department is struggling to retain labour inspectors. Many labour inspectors leave the Department for higher salaries in the private sector and departments such as Mineral Resources. The Department needs to develop a strategy to retain inspectors within the IES in consultation with the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA).",

However, it scored zero in programme 2, which is Human Resource Management and programme 6, which is Turnaround Solutions. The entity had four annual planned indicators for programme 5, which is value chain competitiveness. It achieved two of those indicators translating to an overall achievement of 50%. It is concerning that the entity scored a zero on turnaround solutions programme, which is its core function. This may be attributed to the fact that the grants from UIF towards this programme are not guaranteed and the transfers are always not in full or on time, which resulted in the programme being suspended during the 2018/19 financial year. The reason for poor performance of the entity on core functions is elaborated upon below. 8.4.4. Productivity SA Challenges Productivity SA current funding model does not allow the organisation to adequately achieve its national mandate of leading and inspiring a competitive and productive South Africa. The organisation is also under-resourced in terms of human capacity and the lack of required resources hinders its ability to make a meaningful and desirable impact nationwide. The current challenges emanate from the change in business environment with the promulgation of the Employment Services Act in 2015, which expanded the mandate of Productivity SA to include promoting employment growth and supporting initiatives aimed at preventing job losses. However, there was no additional funding appropriated by Parliament for this expanded mandate. Productivity SA is a national public entity, but its footprint is limited to three provinces resulting in inadequate national coverage and equitable servicing of all the nine provinces. The footprint is reorganised into regional offices (Johannesburg/ Midrand servicing Gauteng, North West and Limpopo; eThekwini/ Durban servicing KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga; and Cape Town servicing the Western Cape, Free State and the Northern Cape). The Funds received from the three sources of funding i.e. DEL, DTI and the UIF are not sufficient for the entity to deliver on its mandate and provide services to the entire country. The persistent applications for additional funds are evidence of the funding problem. 8.4.5. Annual financial performance of Productivity SA as at",

Legislative Mandate The mandate of the UIF is stated in the Unemployment Insurance Act, No. 63 of 2001, as amended. The UIF was established in terms of section 4(1) of the UIA. The Act empowers the UIF to register all employers and employees in South Africa and pay those who qualify for unemployment insurance benefits. The Unemployment Contributions Act (UCA), No. 4 of 2002, empowers the SARS Commissioner and the UI Commissioner to collect monthly contributions from both employers and employees. Section 9 of the UCA empowers the UI Commissioner to collect contributions from all those employers who are not required to register as employers in terms of the fourth schedule of the Income Tax Act, No. 58 of 1962, and who are not liable for the payment of the skills development levy in terms of the Skills Development Act, No. 9 of 1999.

The entity scored 0 on strategic objectives 2 and 3, which is to Strengthen institutional capacity of the Fund and Provide easy to use services through multiple access points respectively. The Fund planned to reduce the vacancy rate to 10% or less but it was at 13.3% (80 vacancies/602 establishment) by 31 March 2019. Failure to meet the target was attributed to high volumes of applications received and the recruitment and selection of 68 internship posts additional to the establishment. The entity upgraded 33 provincial sites with free Wi-Fi against a target of 126. Failure to meet the target was attributed to delays in the appointment of service provider. The UIF planned to develop a test towards the implementation of the integrated claims management system (ICMS). The annual target was not achieved due to delay with the appointment of a service provider and approval for Accenture to conduct handover to the new service provider. The entity achieved 50% on strategic objective 5, which is to collaborate with stakeholders to improve compliance with UIF Acts. It registered 64 577 new employers against a target of 65 000.

COMMITTEE OBSERVATIONS After considering the presentations made by the Department and its entities on their annual reports and the input from the Auditor- General and Advisory Boards, the Committee made the following observations: 9.1. Department of Employment and Labour (DEL) 9.1.1 South Africa's official unemployment rate soared to 29 percent in the second quarter of the year, the highest jobless rate since the start of 2008. 9.1.2 The Department materially underspent the allocated budget by R196.2 million. Effective and appropriate steps were not taken to prevent wasteful, irregular and fruitless expenditure. 9.1.3 Most challenges identified by AGSA in the department had already been identified by internal auditors. However, the department was slow to implement recommendations from internal audit. 9.1.4 The main reason for variance between appropriated funds and expenditure was reported to be the vacancies in the Department that resulted in underspending on Compensation of Employees. 9.1.5 Inspection and Enforcement Services programme has been struggling to attract and retain labour inspectors for the past few years. Many labour inspectors leave the Department for higher salaries in the private sector and to departments such as the Department of Mineral Resources. 9.1.6 With the expanded mandate on Employment, the DEL will require budget allocation increase to create an enabling environment for job creation. 9.1.7 The National Treasury reported that the headcount target for the Department was 3 341 personnel but only 2 690 posts were filled by the end of the first quarter. This translates to 651 vacant posts by the end of the first quarter. 9.2. Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE) 9.2.1 SEE generates its income from the sales of manufactured goods that include furniture, hospital linen, protective clothing, garments, upholstery and screen printing, therefore, requires more government departments to procure from their products in order to be sustainable as an entity. 9.3. Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) 9.3.1 CCMA has additional statutory obligations in terms of the National Minimum Wage, Basic Conditions of Employment Act and Labour Relations Act, which will require additional funding to enable it to fully implement legislation. 9.4. Productivity South Africa (PSA) 9.4.1 PSA continues to experience funding challenges, which led to the suspension of the Turnaround Solutions programme.",

However, the study also shows that the majority of these schemes require a review of their design in order to have maximum outcome to the challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality. The example of review suggested by the study is partly to focus on the exit strategy, graduate youth for example were seen to be benefiting more from schemes like YES and NARYSEC while the youth with no formal qualifications should be afforded pathways to qualifications such as vocational ones while they are in programmes like EPWP. The study shows that we need to think about the end when we start, so that we group young people according to their skill requirements and place them with a pathway for better employability when they exit schemes. It was also found that there is a need for accessibility of information by young people and this finding is the one linked to inequality because young people in rural areas are at disadvantage because of lack of infrastructure and poverty, poor network connectivity and inability to have smart phoned as well as unlimited access to data. We intend sharing the contents of this study with our counterparts in government and other private sector initiatives so as to improve on the impact of these initiatives.",

However, the study also shows that the majority of these schemes require a review of their design in order to have maximum outcome to the challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality. The example of review suggested by the study is partly to focus on the exit strategy, graduate youth for example were seen to be benefiting more from schemes like YES and NARYSEC while the youth with no formal qualifications should be afforded pathways to qualifications such as vocational ones while they are in programmes like EPWP. The study shows that we need to think about the end when we start, so that we group young people according to their skill requirements and place them with a pathway for better employability when they exit schemes. It was also found that there is a need for accessibility of information by young people and this finding is the one linked to inequality because young people in rural areas are at disadvantage because of lack of infrastructure and poverty, poor network connectivity and inability to have smart phoned as well as unlimited access to data. We intend sharing the contents of this study with our counterparts in government and other private sector initiatives so as to improve on the impact of these initiatives.",

Supported Employment Enterprises Recommendation The Committee receives regular updates on engagements between Department of Employment and Labour and National Treasury on preferential procurement status of the SEE. Response A meeting between SEE officials, The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the DEL as well as the office of the Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) from National Treasury was held on the 02 March 2023. The meeting resolved that the Public Procurement Bill that was to be published in the Government Gazette on the 22 May 2023 would somewhat bring about some kind of solution that will be a relief to the solution sort by SEE. The relief is brought by the provision in Section 17 (7) that stipulates that any Minister may submit a request to the Minister of Finance to make regulations regarding a matter pertaining to the portfolio of the relevant Minister, in this case the Minister of Employment and Labour on behalf of SEE. SEE through DEL will have to bring the request to the Minister of Employment and Labour once the Bill is signed by the Head of State. The provision therefore enables SEE, through the Minister of Employment and Labour to submit a request to the Minister of Finance to make regulations under Preferential Procurement Policy as the provision [(Section 17 (7)] stipulates further to say any Minister may submit a request to the Minister of Finance to make regulations regarding a matter pertaining to the portfolio of the relevant Minister, in this case the Minister of Employment and Labour on behalf of SEE. The Department has also included a provision in the Employment Services Amendment Bill that is to be presented to Parliament once approved by Cabinet. The Provision seeks to clarify the legal status of the SEE as a government Trading Entity so that it can also benefit from the Amended Public Procurement Bill. Recommendation DEL must assist SEE to employ people with relevant skills in Finance. Response DEL has ensured that the entity employed a Chief Financial Officer for the entity. 7",

The programme spent R1.0 billion or 95% of the allocation resulting in under-expenditure of R57.4 million. Underspending on Compensation of Employees was mainly because of delays in filling vacant posts. Underspending on Goods and Services was reported to be because of delays in payments for software licensing; reduced travelling; accommodation; subsistence and travelling; and foreign travel. Reduced Capital Expenditure resulted from delays in delivery of procured ICT equipment. Overspending on Payments for Financial Assets was reported to be mainly due to bad debts written off. 4.2.2 Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) The purpose of this programme is to realise decent work by regulating non-employment and employment conditions through inspection and enforcement, to achieve compliance with all labour market policies. IES programme comprise the following sub-programmes: Management and Support Services; Occupational Health and Safety; Registration; Compliance, Monitoring and Enforcement; Training of Staff; and Statutory and Advocacy Services.

Underspending on transfers was reported to be due to few claims of injuries on duty and delays in the last tranche transfer towards GTAC. Underspending on Capital was mainly due to the delays in the delivery of laptops and desktops due to the global shortage from supplier. 4.2.4. Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) The purpose of the LP&IR programme is to facilitate the establishment of an equitable and sound labour relations environment; support institutions of social dialogue and promote South Africa’s interests in international labour matters; conduct research, analysis and evaluate labour policy; and provide statistical data on the labour market.

The Administration programme received R258.9 million, which is the second highest programme budget after programme 4. This programme spent R251.2 million or 97% of the budget resulting to the variance of R7.7 million or 3% of the budget allocation. The variance was reported to result from timing differences in staff recruitment. The other factors that contributed to saving include projects such as JAVS maintenance, BUSA web tool, Helpdesk solution, CMS enhancements, Compliance Management Tool Software and procurement of laptops through the lease option which were budgeted for but not utilised as anticipated, as these projects were not awarded. Further, the employee wellness programme and employee relation activities as well as administration variable expenditure also contributed to the saving as the services are consumed as and when required. Furthermore, the savings related to operating costs result from the travel costs and training interventions which were budgeted for but not utilised as anticipated. Lastly, the saving is also seen in the expenditure resulting from recruitment services. The Labour Market Intervention programme received R14.7 million budget and spent R13.2 million or 90% of the allocation, resulting to the variance of R1.5 million or 10% of the programme budget. The variance was reported to be due to fewer claims received from the Councils on the awards made. The Special Interventions and Support programme received R16.2 million budget allocation and spent R14.7 million or 90% of the allocation resulting to a variance of R1.7 million or 10% of the programme budget. The variance was reported to result from timing difference in staff recruitment. The other contributing factor was saving on part-time commissioners related to mediation interventions. Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Services budget received the budget of R771.5 million, which is the largest portion of the Department’s budget. It spent R757.4 million or 98% of the allocation resulting to a variance of R14.1 million or 2% of the programme budget. The variance was reported to result from the unfilled vacancies related to the support staff and full- time commissioners. Furthermore, savings were realised from variable administration expenses. Strategy Management and Governance programme spent R36.6 million or 94% of the R38.9 million budget resulting to a variance of R2.3 million or 6% of the programme budget. The variance was reported to result from projects such as Qualitative Data Analysis Software, Social Media Management Tool, and Data Analytic Tool which were budgeted for but not utilised as anticipated. Lastly, the saving is also seen from an additional provision that was made for insurance related to procurement of ICT laptops and other assets as well as the saving resulting from travel and subsistence for provincial visits. 8.4.4.2. Audit Outcome The CCMA has maintained an unqualified audit opinion with no findings (clean audit) in the 2022/23 financial year. Irregular Expenditure One case to the value of R36 601 was assessed during the year 2022/23 and was found to have contravened the applicable laws and regulations. Based on the root cause, a recommendation was made by the Loss and Control Committee that the expenditure be recovered. The balance as of 31 March 2023 was R0. Fruitless and Wasteful Expenditure Eight cases to the value of R43 916 were assessed during the 2022/23 financial year and found to have contravened the applicable laws and regulations.

The Administration programme received R258.9 million, which is the second highest programme budget after programme 4. This programme spent R251.2 million or 97% of the budget resulting to the variance of R7.7 million or 3% of the budget allocation. The variance was reported to result from timing differences in staff recruitment. The other factors that contributed to saving include projects such as JAVS maintenance, BUSA web tool, Helpdesk solution, CMS enhancements, Compliance Management Tool Software and procurement of laptops through the lease option which were budgeted for but not utilised as anticipated, as these projects were not awarded. Further, the employee wellness programme and employee relation activities as well as administration variable expenditure also contributed to the saving as the services are consumed as and when required. Furthermore, the savings related to operating costs result from the travel costs and training interventions which were budgeted for but not utilised as anticipated. Lastly, the saving is also seen in the expenditure resulting from recruitment services. The Labour Market Intervention programme received R14.7 million budget and spent R13.2 million or 90% of the allocation, resulting to the variance of R1.5 million or 10% of the programme budget. The variance was reported to be due to fewer claims received from the Councils on the awards made. The Special Interventions and Support programme received R16.2 million budget allocation and spent R14.7 million or 90% of the allocation resulting to a variance of R1.7 million or 10% of the programme budget. The variance was reported to result from timing difference in staff recruitment. The other contributing factor was saving on part-time commissioners related to mediation interventions. Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Services budget received the budget of R771.5 million, which is the largest portion of the Department’s budget. It spent R757.4 million or 98% of the allocation resulting to a variance of R14.1 million or 2% of the programme budget. The variance was reported to result from the unfilled vacancies related to the support staff and full- time commissioners. Furthermore, savings were realised from variable administration expenses. Strategy Management and Governance programme spent R36.6 million or 94% of the R38.9 million budget resulting to a variance of R2.3 million or 6% of the programme budget. The variance was reported to result from projects such as Qualitative Data Analysis Software, Social Media Management Tool, and Data Analytic Tool which were budgeted for but not utilised as anticipated. Lastly, the saving is also seen from an additional provision that was made for insurance related to procurement of ICT laptops and other assets as well as the saving resulting from travel and subsistence for provincial visits. 8.4.4.2. Audit Outcome The CCMA has maintained an unqualified audit opinion with no findings (clean audit) in the 2022/23 financial year. Irregular Expenditure One case to the value of R36 601 was assessed during the year 2022/23 and was found to have contravened the applicable laws and regulations. Based on the root cause, a recommendation was made by the Loss and Control Committee that the expenditure be recovered. The balance as of 31 March 2023 was R0. Fruitless and Wasteful Expenditure Eight cases to the value of R43 916 were assessed during the 2022/23 financial year and found to have contravened the applicable laws and regulations.

The largest share of the budget is allocated to the Labour Policy and Industrial Relations programme, primarily driven by substantial transfers to entities such as the CCMA, which alone receives more than R975 million to support dispute resolution and collective bargaining functions. In contrast, the Public Employment Services programme experiences a decline in funding over the MTEF period, largely due to the phasing out of the Presidential Employment Stimulus funds, which had temporarily boosted employment initiatives. The Administration and Inspection and Enforcement Services programmes show modest growth, reflecting ongoing efforts to strengthen institutional capacity, modernise systems, and enhance labour law compliance and occupational safety enforcement. The total departmental expenditure was expected to decline slightly by 0.5 per cent between 2023/24 and 2026/27, signalling a period of fiscal consolidation while maintaining essential service delivery and regulatory oversight functions.",

Leadership instability further affected performance, with four officials acting as Accounting Officer during the year.

However, persistent vacancies in senior positions, the delay in the SAP Diphetogo system migration, and weaknesses in financial controls affected efficiency. The Department is committed to filling all funded vacancies within the first eight months of the 2025/26 financial year. The Committee should seek clarity on the revised completion timeline of the SAP Diphetogo project, the measures to strengthen internal controls, and the steps being taken to address recurring audit findings Programme 2: Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) The Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) programme achieved its overall performance targets, conducting 310,798 workplace inspections against a target of 298,104. The Branch ensured that 99 per cent of non-compliant employers were served with enforcement notices within 14 days, and 83 per cent of cases were referred for prosecution within 30 days. A total of R37.9 million was recovered through enforcement activities, including R10.4 million under the National Minimum Wage Act. Despite strong performance, the programme underspent R52 million due to vacancies and delays in the procurement of ICT equipment. The Committee may wish to engage the Department on the outcomes of prosecutions, the sustainability of performance under fiscal pressure, and measures to strengthen compliance in low-wage sectors such as domestic and agricultural work. Programme 3: Public Employment Services (PES) The Public Employment Services (PES) branch performed relatively well, exceeding its key targets. It registered over 1.3 million work-seekers against a target of 950,000 and facilitated nearly 99,000 placements, mainly among youth and women. The programme also hosted numerous career fairs, job exhibitions, and counselling initiatives. However, challenges persist in converting placements into long-term employment and addressing the mismatch between work-seekers’ skills and available job opportunities. The finalisation of the National Labour Migration Policy (NLMP) and the Employment Services Amendment Bill (ESAB) remain outstanding, as both documents were still awaiting Cabinet approval at the close of the financial year. The Committee should request updates on the reasons for the delay in approval, strategies for tracking post-placement outcomes, and measures to ensure that employment services are sustainable and impactful. Programme 4: Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) The Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) branch achieved 80 per cent of its annual targets. The programme successfully implemented and reviewed the National Minimum Wage (NMW), produced labour market trend reports, and represented South Africa in several international forums, including the ILO, BRICS, and G20 engagements. However, workplace transformation remains slow, with many employers failing to meet Employment Equity (EE) targets. The Committee should examine the Department’s enforcement mechanisms for EE compliance, the support provided to the NMW Commission in reviewing wage adjustments, and strategies to accelerate sectoral transformation.",

The Department reported an overall expenditure of R3.80 billion, translating to a spending rate of 98.6 per cent, which indicates that it generally maintained sound budgetary control despite certain operational inefficiencies. No unauthorised expenditure was recorded during the reporting period, demonstrating adherence to appropriation limits; however, the Department continues to face challenges related to irregular, fruitless, and wasteful expenditure. The Department’s spending was distributed across four main programmes, namely Administration, Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES), Public Employment Services (PES), and Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR). Programme 1: Administration Expenditure under the Administration Programme amounted to R1.065 billion, representing full utilisation of the allocation. The bulk of this spending covered personnel costs, ICT infrastructure upgrades, and litigation expenses. Delays in finalising key ICT projects, particularly the SAP Diphetogo migration, resulted in additional costs for software licences and system maintenance. Despite the full expenditure rate, the Department reported R23 million in fruitless and wasteful expenditure arising from payments for unused SAP licences. Programme 2: Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) The Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) Programme recorded an expenditure of R548 million out of an allocated R600 million, resulting in an underspending of R52 million or 8.7 per cent. The underspending was primarily attributed to vacant posts, delays in procuring ICT equipment and vehicles for labour inspectors, and lower-than-anticipated payments for provincial operational expenses. Despite the underspending, the programme exceeded its inspection targets and achieved significant recoveries of unpaid wages for vulnerable workers. Programme 3: Public Employment Services (PES) The Public Employment Services (PES) Programme spent its full budget of R929.9 million, with funds channelled towards employment counselling, job placement programmes, and subsidies to non-profit organisations that assist in training and employment facilitation. While spending performance was strong, the Department reported delays in the submission of expenditure documentation by certain funded organisations, which affected financial reporting timelines. This remains an area that requires tighter monitoring to ensure compliance with grant conditions and value-for-money outcomes. Programme 4: Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) The Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) Programme also achieved full expenditure of R1.26 billion, with a significant portion of the allocation transferred to public entities such as the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), NEDLAC, and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) for membership fees. The programme managed all its transfers efficiently, and no material variances were reported. However, the Department continues to face challenges in",

South Africa’s economy grew by approximately 1.2 per cent, driven mainly by a modest recovery in the services and manufacturing sectors, while energy supply interruptions, logistics inefficiencies, and subdued investment confidence continued to impede productivity. Fiscal consolidation measures limited public sector spending, directly affecting the Department’s operational capacity, particularly in employment facilitation, infrastructure maintenance, and the filling of critical vacancies. The labour market remained under significant pressure, with an official unemployment rate of 32.1 per cent and youth unemployment above 43 per cent. Formal job creation remained stagnant as businesses struggled under high operating costs and slow economic growth. The Department’s employment and enforcement programmes were therefore implemented amid rising demand for public employment services and greater pressure to protect vulnerable workers through compliance inspections, minimum wage enforcement, and equity promotion. High inflation and rising living costs also intensified worker vulnerability and reduced real incomes, underscoring the importance of effective labour protection and fair wage policies. The broader economic conditions also affected the performance of Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE), whose revenue declined sharply due to reduced public sector procurement and weak private demand.

    "recommendation": "4.2 Financial performance of the Department During the 2024/25 financial year, the Department operated in a constrained administrative and fiscal environment. The implementation of DPSA Circular 49 of 2023 imposed strict controls on the filling of vacancies, which led to a 232-post increase in the Department’s vacancy rate, now standing at 34 per cent. Leadership instability further affected performance, with four officials acting as Accounting Officer during the year. The Department also faced major ICT challenges, with outdated systems and delayed migration to modern SAP platforms. Several Labour Centres, including the Klerksdorp office, continued to operate in temporary or inadequate facilities, which affected service delivery.

    "recommendation": "4.3 Programme Performance Analysis Programme 1: Administration Programme 1: Administration, the Department spent R1.065 billion, achieving most of its administrative objectives, including maintaining a 50 per cent representation of women in senior management and 2.6 per cent representation of persons with disabilities. However, persistent vacancies in senior positions, the delay in the SAP Diphetogo system migration, and weaknesses in financial controls affected efficiency. The Department is committed to filling all funded vacancies within the first eight months of the 2025/26 financial year. The Committee should seek clarity on the revised completion timeline of the SAP Diphetogo project, the measures to strengthen internal controls, and the steps being taken to address recurring audit findings Programme 2: Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) The Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) programme achieved its overall performance targets, conducting 310,798 workplace inspections against a target of 298,104. The Branch ensured that 99 per cent of non-compliant employers were served with enforcement notices within 14 days, and 83 per cent of cases were referred for prosecution within 30 days. A total of R37.9 million was recovered through enforcement activities, including R10.4 million under the National Minimum Wage Act. Despite strong performance, the programme underspent R52 million due to vacancies and delays in the procurement of ICT equipment. The Committee may wish to engage the Department on the outcomes of prosecutions, the sustainability of performance under fiscal pressure, and measures to strengthen compliance in low-wage sectors such as domestic and agricultural work. Programme 3: Public Employment Services (PES) The Public Employment Services (PES) branch performed relatively well, exceeding its key targets. It registered over 1.3 million work-seekers against a target of 950,000 and facilitated nearly 99,000 placements, mainly among youth and women. The programme also hosted numerous career fairs, job exhibitions, and counselling initiatives. However, challenges persist in converting placements into long-term employment and addressing the mismatch between work-seekers’ skills and available job opportunities. The finalisation of the National Labour Migration Policy (NLMP) and the Employment Services Amendment Bill (ESAB) remain outstanding, as both documents were still awaiting Cabinet approval at the close of the financial year. The Committee should request updates on the reasons for the delay in approval, strategies for tracking post-placement outcomes, and measures to ensure that employment services are sustainable and impactful. Programme 4: Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) The Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) branch achieved 80 per cent of its annual targets. The programme successfully implemented and reviewed the National Minimum Wage (NMW), produced labour market trend reports, and represented South Africa in several international forums, including the ILO, BRICS, and G20 engagements. However, workplace transformation remains slow, with many employers failing to meet Employment Equity (EE) targets. The Committee should examine the Department’s enforcement mechanisms for EE compliance, the support provided to the NMW Commission in reviewing wage adjustments, and strategies to accelerate sectoral transformation.",

The Department reported an overall expenditure of R3.80 billion, translating to a spending rate of 98.6 per cent, which indicates that it generally maintained sound budgetary control despite certain operational inefficiencies. No unauthorised expenditure was recorded during the reporting period, demonstrating adherence to appropriation limits; however, the Department continues to face challenges related to irregular, fruitless, and wasteful expenditure. The Department’s spending was distributed across four main programmes, namely Administration, Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES), Public Employment Services (PES), and Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR). Programme 1: Administration Expenditure under the Administration Programme amounted to R1.065 billion, representing full utilisation of the allocation. The bulk of this spending covered personnel costs, ICT infrastructure upgrades, and litigation expenses. Delays in finalising key ICT projects, particularly the SAP Diphetogo migration, resulted in additional costs for software licences and system maintenance. Despite the full expenditure rate, the Department reported R23 million in fruitless and wasteful expenditure arising from payments for unused SAP licences. Programme 2: Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) The Inspection and Enforcement Services (IES) Programme recorded an expenditure of R548 million out of an allocated R600 million, resulting in an underspending of R52 million or 8.7 per cent. The underspending was primarily attributed to vacant posts, delays in procuring ICT equipment and vehicles for labour inspectors, and lower-than-anticipated payments for provincial operational expenses. Despite the underspending, the programme exceeded its inspection targets and achieved significant recoveries of unpaid wages for vulnerable workers. Programme 3: Public Employment Services (PES) The Public Employment Services (PES) Programme spent its full budget of R929.9 million, with funds channelled towards employment counselling, job placement programmes, and subsidies to non-profit organisations that assist in training and employment facilitation. While spending performance was strong, the Department reported delays in the submission of expenditure documentation by certain funded organisations, which affected financial reporting timelines. This remains an area that requires tighter monitoring to ensure compliance with grant conditions and value-for-money outcomes. Programme 4: Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) The Labour Policy and Industrial Relations (LP&IR) Programme also achieved full expenditure of R1.26 billion, with a significant portion of the allocation transferred to public entities such as the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), NEDLAC, and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) for membership fees. The programme managed all its transfers efficiently, and no material variances were reported. However, the Department continues to face challenges in",

South Africa’s economy grew by approximately 1.2 per cent, driven mainly by a modest recovery in the services and manufacturing sectors, while energy supply interruptions, logistics inefficiencies, and subdued investment confidence continued to impede productivity. Fiscal consolidation measures limited public sector spending, directly affecting the Department’s operational capacity, particularly in employment facilitation, infrastructure maintenance, and the filling of critical vacancies. The labour market remained under significant pressure, with an official unemployment rate of 32.1 per cent and youth unemployment above 43 per cent. Formal job creation remained stagnant as businesses struggled under high operating costs and slow economic growth. The Department’s employment and enforcement programmes were therefore implemented amid rising demand for public employment services and greater pressure to protect vulnerable workers through compliance inspections, minimum wage enforcement, and equity promotion. High inflation and rising living costs also intensified worker vulnerability and reduced real incomes, underscoring the importance of effective labour protection and fair wage policies. The broader economic conditions also affected the performance of Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE), whose revenue declined sharply due to reduced public sector procurement and weak private demand.

    "recommendation": "2015 Estimates of National Expenditure guidelines required departments to demonstrate this link. In the 2014 MTBPS, most of the five-year Medium Term Strategic Framework’s priorities are financed within the three-year medium-term expenditure framework. Where funds are needed to expand or introduce new programmes, savings have been sourced from baseline budgets, or implementation will be phased in gradually. In addition, significant resources were left unallocated in the third year of the framework to serve as a buffer against fiscal and economic shocks. A portion of this may also be used to finance high-impact programmes aligned with core Medium Term Strategic Framework objectives. Scaling up best practice in the public service The National Treasury, in conjunction with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, should consider the establishment of an innovation unit that will identify and assess mechanisms for scaling up best practice across the public service in the areas of cost-containment efficiencies, medium-term expenditure framework planning and target formulation, job-creation initiatives, utilising shared services and the development of innovative solutions for the delivery of public services. Active efforts should be made to ensure that best practice on efficiencies is disseminated to all parts of the public service. The National Treasury agrees with the committee. A number of initiatives, including guidelines on cost- containment measures and the framework for strategic plans and annual performance plans, are already being implemented. The Department of Public Service and Administration will play a significant role in improving best practice in the public service – it already has a specific unit that focuses on innovation in the public sector, and develops policies and creative solutions to enhance service delivery. Setting efficiency targets The National Treasury, in conjunction with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, should consider the inclusion of efficiency targets as a planning requirement in the frameworks guiding the compilation of strategic plans and annual performance plans. The Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation is now responsible for overseeing the compilation of strategic plans and annual performance plans. The National Treasury supports the committee’s recommendation that institutions should include efficiency targets as part of their planning process. Leveraging funding streams for higher education The National Treasury, in partnership with the Department of Higher Education and Training, should consider mechanisms for leveraging funding streams within the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) and the National Skills Fund towards student funding in higher education, especially increased funding for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. The Minister of Higher Education and Training gazetted the SETA Grant Regulations on 3 December",

    "recommendation": "2014 Revised Fiscal Framework Differentiate strategic and non-strategic assets The National Treasury needs to be very clear about the criteria it uses to define non- strategic assets and the terms of any sale of these. The National Treasury also needs to seek to ensure that the sale of these non-strategic assets does not lead to job losses or other unintended consequences that undermine the country’s economic growth and developmental goals. One of the main criteria used to differentiate strategic assets from non-strategic assets is that the former are critical for driving economic growth and achieving the National Development Plan’s objectives, including job creation. The National Treasury will seek to avoid job losses and other unintended negative consequences for growth and development. Financial performance of state-owned entities The sale of non-strategic assets, however defined, could be contested and could take time. However, some state-owned entities need financial assistance more immediately. The National Treasury will have to speedily finalise measures to separate the commercial and developmental aspects of the state-owned entities and other measures to assist the entities in ways that contribute to improving their financial position in the interim. In addition to differentiating the commercial and developmental activities of state-owned entities, other steps are also being taken to improve their financial performance. Cabinet will consider a range of measures for improving state-owned entity performance. The Deputy President, in collaboration with the relevant ministers, will oversee the turnaround of Eskom, South African Airways, the South African Post Office and SANRAL, and engagements have already begun in this regard. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 Mitigating risks in implementing the 2015/16 Budget The 2015/16 Budget will have to clearly set out how National Treasury will realise the assumptions of the MTBPS and mitigate the risks to implementing it. Government aims to lower the spending ceiling in 2015/16 and 2016/17, and realise targets for tax revenue over the MTEF period. Since its introduction in 2012/13, government has adhered to its spending ceiling. To ensure that this continues, budgets for non-essential goods and services have been frozen at 2014/15 levels, funding for longstanding vacant posts has been withdrawn, and adjustments will be made to tax policy and administration. Proposals will be introduced in the 2015 Budget to generate additional revenue of at least R44 billion over the MTEF period. Rapid economic growth in the context of stable prices would enable government to attain its fiscal objectives earlier. If economic growth and revenue targets are not met, the fiscal package will mitigate some of these risks by helping to reduce the current account deficit. Deterioration in the economic outlook, however, would require additional measures. The proposed fiscal framework allows for R5 billion, R15 billion and R45 billion in unallocated reserves for 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18 respectively. These funds will serve as a fiscal buffer, although a portion could also be used to fund high- impact programmes. Domestic constraints The National Treasury needs to be clearer about how government is going to deal with the domestic constraints to growth, including badly managed labour disputes, electricity and transport challenges, skills shortages and some policy uncertainties. Government recognises that addressing challenges related to labour, infrastructure and policy uncertainty is critical to improving long-term growth and employment prospects. One of its most urgent priorities will be ensuring that maintenance and refurbishment plans are completed on time to secure and sustain electricity supply. Electricity supply is augmented through imports from Namibia and Mozambique, and cogeneration will also relieve pressure on the grid. If necessary, various forms of financial support will be considered, as announced in the 2014 MTBPS. Unemployment remains the largest constraint to growth. Government supports employment through various initiatives, including the Expanded Public Works Programme, the employment tax incentive, the Jobs Fund and the establishment of special economic zones. The Medium Term Strategic Framework noted that improving dispute-resolution mechanisms in labour relations is a critical intervention. Government is engaging with the National Economic Development and Labour Council to work together to strengthen and improve labour relations in South Africa. The Medium Term Strategic Framework outlines key transportation projects such as expanding rail capacity for coal exports between Mpumalanga and the Richards Bay Coal Terminal, building a new heavy-haul rail line from the Waterberg region, and increasing port capacity for iron exports via Saldanha and the Northern Cape corridor. Investing in these projects will result in higher productivity over time. The Medium Term Strategic Framework has also prioritised enhancing the performance of sea ports and inland terminals, revising and consolidating port charges, establishing a single transport regulator and reducing cross-subsidisation in transport pricing. A system is being implemented to rationalise the tariffs charged at ports, and the Ports Regulator is analysing the cost of providing various services at ports to help inform future tariff increases. Implementing cost-containment measures in provinces and municipalities The National Treasury will have to, through a variety of ways, assist provinces and municipalities to implement cost-containment proposals. The Committee wants to be briefed on this periodically.",

If government is more effective in reducing corruption, there will be significant savings and the National Treasury will be in a better position to carefully decide on tax increases. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 119 Proactive systems, processes and interventions need to be put in place to combat corruption. The Chief Procurement Officer released the Public Sector Supply Chain Management Review, which sets out the supply chain management modernisation programme. Government has declared supply chain management a strategic function. Accounting officers are required to build supply chain management capability within their departments and provide performance reports to executive authorities on a quarterly basis. The Chief Procurement Officer needs to accelerate the reform agenda. If properly implemented, this reform should, in addition to reducing corruption, improve and accelerate quality service delivery and reduce costs. The National Treasury has also established a unit to detect fraud and corruption in government’s procurement processes. The forensic investigations help recover misappropriated state funds and support criminal proceedings. The National Treasury believes that prevention is better than cure. As a result, it focuses its efforts on improving controls and governance structures to prevent fraud, rather than detecting it after the fact (which is the primary responsibility of other government departments and agencies). Practices are constantly reviewed and regulations and guides are updated to improve service and governance in the public sector. Advocacy of National Treasury programmes In view of the lack of investor and public confidence in the prospects of economic growth, the National Treasury needs to actively communicate its programmes and activities through the public media and its own media, and through other ways. The Ministry of Finance and the National Treasury’s communication engagements include meeting with business, trade union and civil society leaders, giving speeches and conducting media interviews. In addition, the National Treasury manages an active investor relations programme (domestic and international road shows, use of the website, bilateral meetings), which aims to strengthen relationships with investors who buy government bonds.",

    "recommendation": "• Issues raised in previous BRRRs should be addressed. Some committees also recommended that additional budget allocations be made available for particular programmes, sub-programmes or other budget items. However, the scope for additional funding is limited given the constrained fiscal outlook. Departments, public entities and constitutional institutions were required to reprioritise funds within their existing baselines to fund new priorities. Should the fiscal outlook improve, recommendations for additional funding may be considered in future budget processes. The rest of this report details the Minister of Finance’s response to matters contained in the other committee reports. Where different reports make the same recommendations, responses have not been repeated. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the 2016 MTBPS Identification of programmes at risk with regards to budget execution The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME), develops systems and mechanisms targeted at identifying those programmes and spending areas that are most at risk with regards to budget execution. These identified programmes and spending areas are to be submitted to the committee. The DPME is leading government’s effort to evaluate programmes. The National Treasury works closely with the DPME to identify programmes and spending areas that are at risk in respect of budget execution. A full presentation will be available for the committee’s consideration during the course of 2017. Guidelines to contain personnel costs without affecting service delivery The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) and the DPME, develops comprehensive cost-containment guidelines targeted at national and provincial departments of education and health, ensuring that posts for critical staff are protected in relation to service-delivery requirements, payroll management is effective, and that all districts have costed human resource plans and innovative methodologies to contain costs without compromising service delivery. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 Departments have prepared human resource budget plans indicating critical posts that have to be funded. Mechanisms for exiting non-critical posts such as employee-initiated severance packages are available within the current public service regulations, to implement where necessary. In some provinces, premiers’ offices have taken control of payroll management. Provinces have been encouraged to budget adequately for health personnel, particularly for occupation-specific dispensation posts. Provinces have imposed restrictions on filling vacant posts, requiring all appointments, excluding health and education critical posts, to be approved by both the provincial treasury and the office of the premier. The National Treasury agrees with the need to identify and protect critical posts, especially in areas where access to healthcare is already limited. In principle, the National Treasury believes that the prioritisation of posts is best done locally, and will continue to engage with the Department of Health and the Department of Education, and provincial treasuries, to find ways to manage budget pressures and to provide guidance on the best approach for critical posts in the context of constrained budgets. The Minister of Finance and MECs for Finance have agreed that health service staff should be protected while containing administrative personnel expenditure. Only new vacant posts in health and education not budgeted for (particularly for new facilities) need the approval of the provincial treasuries and offices of the premier, because additional funding may be required. This will ensure that provinces keep to the set expenditure ceilings without negatively affecting service delivery. Aligning resource planning with the NDP The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury develops and publishes a long-term fiscal report that spans the timeframes outlined in the NDP. This will assist the country in aligning resource planning towards long-term fiscal sustainability. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The intention is to expand the Fiscal Risk Statement (to be published as part of the 2017 MTBPS in October) to include more detail on the long-term fiscal outlook. As suggested by the committee, this will span the timeframes outlined in the NDP. The impact of infrastructure projects on communities The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with Statistics South Africa and the DPME, develops indicators that will assist national and provincial departments and state-owned entities to track the impact of infrastructure programmes on communities, including jobs and economic participation. These should assist in detecting challenges early to allow for rapid remedial response. The National Treasury agrees to a coordinated approach with Statistics South Africa and the DPME to improve the indicators used to track the impact of service delivery related to infrastructure. Statistics South Africa has established a system with readily available data based on community surveys and other statistics that it collates and reports. Well-designed monitoring frameworks should include performance indicators at input, activity, output and outcome levels to ensure that departments are able to monitor progress on policy objectives. The National Treasury will continue to support departments and public entities in refining monitoring frameworks to ensure that government objectives are consistently tracked and reported. Outreach programmes on the use of reporting systems The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with the DPME, embarks on education outreach programmes to all departments and state entities on the use and access to rich datasets contained in the prevailing systems of government such as, though not limited to, the Basic Accounting System and PERSAL.",

    "recommendation": "2017 BUDGET REVIEW 114 A National Treasury survey on the use of systems for reporting purposes found that a high percentage of the sampled respondents did not know how to use reporting systems such as the Vulindlela Management Information System. This system provides access to the datasets contained in all the transversal transactional systems of government. Departments tend to use the Basic Accounting System, which is the main transactional system, for reporting. Budgets allowing, departments would benefit from extending their use to include the rest of the available systems for their reporting. The move to an integrated financial management system will have a long-term effect. Implementing the system will require substantial adjustments and the retraining of data users, which will provide an opportunity to educate users and managers on the use of data from the various financial systems. Growth-enhancing initiatives The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury and the DPME, together with relevant stakeholders, cascade best practice in economic growth-enhancing initiatives and partnership models such as the Invest SA One Stop Shop, the CEO Initiative and the Presidential Business Working Group to provincial and local spheres of government. An extensive programme of engagement with local and provincial government on the ease of doing business is under way. It includes work with the Department of Trade and Industry, the Government Technical Advisory Centre and the World Bank to disseminate best practice on how local government should work. The Department of Trade and Industry is the lead department in the Invest SA One Stop Shop initiative. The National Treasury is ready to support it in any way possible. The CEO Initiative has focused on national programmes. The National Treasury will share lessons learnt with the other spheres of government. A report on the suggestions from business will be shared with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs for dissemination. Instruction note on cost containment for major infrastructure projects The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury considers formulating and developing cost-control instruction notes for all major infrastructure programmes of government, similar to the newly developed cost-control instruction notes governing school construction. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer issued an instruction note in 2015. The note gave effect to cost- control measures for the construction of new primary and secondary schools and the provision of additional buildings at existing schools. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer also published the Standard for Infrastructure Procurement and Delivery Management in November 2015, which became effective on 1 July",

The office continues to consider similar interventions to improve efficiency and control measures where necessary. Cost-containment measures for foreign missions The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury considers formulating and developing special cost-control instruction notes for all foreign missions and immediately embarks on a comprehensive reprioritisation drive in South Africa’s foreign missions. The National Treasury will issue an instruction note to departments operating foreign missions. During the 2017 Budget process, the National Treasury has engaged with the Department of International Relations and Cooperation on the possible rationalisation of foreign missions and related costs. Over the medium term, the department has committed to implementing various initiatives, such as rescheduling existing foreign infrastructure projects, reviewing the foreign service dispensation, reducing voluntary membership fee contributions, and rationalising locally recruited personnel in foreign missions. Consequently, R183.6 million will be reprioritised from various goods and services items and payments for capital assets over the medium term. Enhancing financial management capacity in departments and entities The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, together with the DPME, the Auditor-General of South Africa and relevant partners, strengthens targeted training and other capacity-enhancing initiatives aimed at those departments and state- ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 115 owned entities that are at risk in the areas of supply chain management, financial management, monitoring and evaluation functions, bolstering the internal control environment and internal audit functions. The Capacity Development Strategy for Public Financial Management seeks to address the capacity constraints of the state in an integrated and holistic manner. The implementation of the strategy includes the design, development and piloting of various education and training solutions across government. Select programmes will become mandatory in an effort to develop generic core competencies. A public financial management portal has been designed and is being implemented to provide a platform for knowledge and information sharing, networking and learning. Relations with the relevant sector education and training authorities are being strengthened to ensure strategic alignment, funding and delivery of priority programmes. A draft business case on professionalising financial management and a draft framework for financial management education and training have been developed for consultation. Introducing cost-containment targets into resource planning The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with the DPME, considers the inclusion of comprehensive cost-containment targets in resource planning and budgeting frameworks to ensure enhanced emphasis of cost-containment principles in the implementation of government programmes.

    "recommendation": "2017 BUDGET REVIEW 116 The Department of Public Works has embarked on several initiatives to facilitate improvements in the management of government property. The department, through its Property Management Trading Entity, is finalising and verifying its asset register, which has begun to provide a more accurate account of the number of buildings or immovable assets in its portfolio. The trading entity has developed a user-charge model, which will enable the department to determine the real costs of providing government accommodation. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, together with the Property Management Trading Entity, did a comparative analysis in 2015/16 of rentals paid by government versus market-related rentals. The sector has also been made aware of the reforms on procurement as well as government’s implementation of a new framework for leasing procurement. Talks have started with holders of large portfolios and landlords to renegotiate leases. A new property empowerment policy is being developed and a property management and leasing framework has been developed. The standard for leasing and letting for the public sector is expected to be issued by 1 April 2017 for use across government. The National Treasury will continue to support the Department of Public Works and the Property Management Trading Entity in their work to introduce more effective and efficient asset management practices that could unlock the vast and underexploited economic potential in government’s immovable asset portfolio. Earmarking of funds for early childhood development programmes The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury puts in place measures to ensure that funds earmarked for early childhood development (ECD) programmes are used only for that specific purpose and prioritise emphasis on the quality of the programme directed at concrete efforts at foundational learning and teaching. Provincial departments of education are responsible for the delivery of Grade R. Provincial departments of social development are responsible for ECD for children aged 0-4 years old. Each provincial department of education and social development has an ECD budget programme that funds components of ECD. Provincial treasuries have an oversight role and monitor spending on a monthly basis and link spending to the objectives. The new early childhood development grant coming into effect in 2017/18 will enable the Department of Social Development to ring-fence funds for the expansion of ECD and to facilitate compliance with the National Integrated Early Childhood Development Policy. Provinces will not be able to use conditional grant funding to replace funding for items that they have previously allocated to ECD subsidies. This ensures that any investment provinces have made in ECD in the past remains within the ECD budget. If a child is subsidised in one year, the place that child holds will continue to be subsidised indefinitely – the number of children subsidised will not decrease. Part of the Department of Social Development’s responsibilities under the new conditional grant will be to develop a standardised reporting framework and monitoring tool for the grant and to take appropriate action in cases of non-compliance with the conditional grant framework. The importance of inclusive economic growth The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders develop and roll out a detailed programme identifying all factors needed for the attainment of inclusive growth and incorporate these into dialogues with legislatures, departments and other role players so as to outline concrete steps that need to be taken and to emphasise the importance of inclusive economic growth as a necessary condition to support radical social and economic transformation. The National Treasury is developing a detailed plan for these key factors, which it will share with the National Planning Commission, the DPME, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Economic Development for careful consideration to inform the development of inclusive growth strategies. Timely payment of teachers and nurses The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury puts in place measures to ensure that payments for personnel in critical positions such as teachers, nurses and all other school and hospital staff are timeous and adhere to agreed employment contracts. No teacher or nurse should be unpaid following the rendering of services. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 The government relies on a payroll and personnel management system called PERSAL. The system is well maintained and programmed to release payments to staff promptly. Provinces have to ensure that correct and adequate information is captured on the system on time. There are specialised units within the National Treasury, the DPSA and the State Information Technology Agency that ensure that PERSAL is working well to avoid non-payment of staff. Social and behavioural change programmes to reduce non-communicable diseases The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, together with the Department of Health, considers ways of leveraging resources within available funds for the provision of social and behavioural change programmes. This will highlight the importance of good nutrition, especially in children and poor communities, so as to reduce the prevalence of non-communicable diseases. This should have a positive effect on quality of life trajectories of children, especially in rural and disadvantaged communities. The Minister of Finance announced in the 2016 Budget the decision to introduce a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages to address obesity and the non-communicable disease burden in South Africa. The National Treasury is committed to working with the Department of Health to support initiatives alongside the sugar tax to decrease the incidence of obesity and non-communicable diseases. Decreasing the public’s preference and demand for unhealthy food products through education, and detecting and preventing non-communicable diseases, are critical to reducing obesity. The Department of Health’s integrated school health programme promotes healthy habits among school children. Reprioritisation of funds within the Department of Communications The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, together with the Department of Communications, embarks on a comprehensive reprioritisation programme within the Department of Communications’ portfolio so as to realise efficiencies and leverage savings towards the funding of the Department of Communications in the areas of basic office infrastructure and critical personnel support services and critical programmes such as the digital terrestrial television project. The Department of Communications and the National Treasury have embarked on a reprioritisation exercise to fund critical personnel support services and the digital terrestrial television project. As a result, R32 million has been reprioritised from the transfer payments to the South African Broadcasting Corporation over the medium term. The National Treasury, the Department of Communications and the Department of Public Works are looking at the accommodation requirements for the Department of Communications to determine the funding requirements for office accommodation.

For example, the department’s Sector Education and Training Authorities Coordination Unit in the Skills Development Branch should drive the budget reprioritisation process in conjunction with the boards of the training authorities. The National Treasury is prepared to assist the department. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer will support the department on the best procurement approaches once it submits a request to the National Treasury for help with the review of major cost drivers in entities in the post-school sector. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the 2016 Adjustments Appropriation Bill Linking financial and non-financial information in expenditure reports The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation should ensure that the National Treasury and the DPME consider developing and implementing systems for the compilation of consolidated quarterly reports combining financial and non- financial performance and present these jointly to the committee. The National Treasury is reviewing the formats of the monthly and quarterly reports and will involve the DPME in the review process. Alignment of budget and strategic planning within the National Treasury The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury aligns and enhances its budget planning and strategic planning function to ensure that annual performance plans align with programme budget allocations. The National Treasury recognises the importance of coordinating and integrating planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring functions. It continues to strengthen strategic planning and budgeting mechanisms. It works closely with the DPME to improve strategic planning capabilities within government and ensure that the sequencing of planning and budgeting is aligned, and performance reporting is enhanced to promote evidence-based decision making. The filling of critical vacant posts within the National Treasury The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury fills all critical vacant posts timeously. The National Treasury has frozen all unfunded vacant positions as part of its cost-containment measures. To ensure that service delivery is not negatively affected by this decision, a recruitment committee chaired by the Director-General was established. This committee meets regularly to assess all current vacancies and approve critical posts that need to be filled urgently. All the approved critical posts have been filled promptly, with a turnaround time of between four and five weeks, and a vacancy rate of 1.5 per cent as at 31 December 2016. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the 2016 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill In-year revision of conditional grant frameworks The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury effects the proposed corrections to the conditional grant frameworks that were submitted together with the bill, in accordance with section 16(4) of the Division of Revenue Act (2016). The corrections were implemented as recommended by Parliament.",

    "recommendation": "that will be affected by the reduction of the bucket eradication programme grant, as well as future plans for those projects. Municipalities with reduced indicative allocations were allocated funds in the 2016 Budget to account for these reductions. In some cases, the projects will cost less than expected by the end of 2016/17, allowing the funds to be shifted to projects elsewhere. Furthermore, there have been delays due to changes in the scope of work and technical challenges, such as the need to upgrade bulk supplies or drill through more rock than anticipated. In these cases, it will not be possible to spend the planned amounts in 2016/17, so the funds are reprioritised to other projects where they can be spent. The bucket eradication projects not completed by the end of 2016/17 will be funded and completed through the water services infrastructure grant and the regional bulk infrastructure grant in 2017/18. Details of which projects in each of these grants are supporting the completion of bucket eradication projects will be provided to Parliament during hearings on the 2017 Division of Revenue Bill. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and the conditional grant allocations to provincial and local spheres of government as contained in the 2016 MTBPS Monitoring of spending on capital projects The National Treasury should closely monitor spending on capital projects as well as provide guidance and support to sector departments and municipalities. The recommendation is supported. The National Treasury and sector departments provide extensive support for grant design and monitoring. In addition, the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent and sector departments have undertaken extensive work to ensure that municipalities have the capacity to map the infrastructure delivery cycle, which includes planning and making provision for infrastructure maintenance, repairs and replacement. Review of the provincial equitable share formula The National Treasury should ensure that the review process of the provincial equitable share formula, where applicable, factors in some of the concerns raised by provinces. The recommendation is supported. The formula is being reviewed to determine whether its components remain responsive to the country's realities. Provincial treasuries form part of this task team and have raised the matters that are of importance to them. Reduction of allocations to provincial and local government grants The National Treasury should ensure that the proposed reductions in allocations to a number of provincial infrastructure grants do not compromise the NDP targets as expressed within the medium-term strategic framework. That is, the provision of an efficient, competitive and responsive economic infrastructure network.

    "recommendation": "5 per cent per year over the 2017 MTEF period. Prioritising basic services in local government The National Treasury and municipalities should ensure that the funds added to the local government equitable share are used as planned. That is, to offset the cost pressures of bulk water and electricity. Section 227 of the Constitution specifies that local government is “entitled to an equitable share of revenue raised nationally to enable it to provide basic services and perform the functions allocated to it”. The local government equitable share is therefore an unconditional allocation. However, Section 153 of the Constitution states that a municipality must manage its administration and budgeting and planning processes to give priority to the basic needs of the community. Municipalities are therefore expected to prioritise the provision of free basic services in their budgets. The National Treasury and provincial treasuries will ensure that this happens through budget benchmarking processes with municipalities. Review of the local government equitable share formula The announced plans to update the local government equitable share formula with the 2016 Community Survey data should be applied in such a manner that it has minimal negative impact on certain municipalities. The release of the 2016 Community Survey provided an opportunity to update the household numbers in the formula using the most recent data. The current model for estimating household numbers has proven to be broadly consistent with the Community Survey results in most cases. However, few municipalities will experience significant changes in their allocations as a result of these updates. The Budget Forum has endorsed a three-year phase-in to minimise the impact of allocation changes to these municipalities. In 2017/18, all municipalities are guaranteed to receive at least 95 per cent of the indicative allocation for the equitable share published in the 2016 division of revenue. Improving the delivery of electrification and other basic services in metropolitan municipalities The National Treasury should ensure that coordination between the delivery of electrification and other basic services is improved in cities by incorporating the integrated national electrification programme (municipal) grant allocations for metros into the urban settlements development grant. This recommendation is supported. The National Treasury will work with the Department of Energy and the Department of Human Settlements on incorporating the integrated national electrification programme (municipal) grant allocations for metropolitan municipalities into the urban settlements development grant for 2018/19. Recommendations of the Select and Standing Committees on Finance on the 2016 Revised Fiscal Framework Managing the refinancing of maturing debt The committees note that a significant amount of long-term government debt will start to mature in 2018/19 and recommend that the National Treasury plans effectively for that and reports to committees at the 2017 MTBPS. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 121 In planning for the maturing debt over the period 2017/18 to 2020/21, the National Treasury introduced a bond- switch programme in 2014/15, exchanging shorter dated debt (bonds maturing over the period 2017/18 to 2020/21) for longer dated debt to address the high refinancing risk to the government debt portfolio. Of the R404.2 billion that was outstanding in maturing debt as at February 2015, R130.4 billion has been exchanged as at January 2017. In addition to the budgeted cash for repayment of maturing debt, the National Treasury will continue with the bond-switch auction programme to manage the refinancing of maturing debt. Strengthening the social pact to improve economic growth While recognising the difficulties, the committees recommend that the National Treasury and government as a whole intensify efforts at cooperation between government, Parliament, the private sector, trade unions and civil society to improve economic growth and create jobs. The National Treasury supports the recommendation. Building cooperation between government, Parliament, the private sector, trade unions and civil society is a critical part of inclusive economic growth. The National Treasury continues to support and engage with such efforts wherever possible. Increasing policy certainty in key sectors of the economy The committees recommend that the National Treasury and government as a whole provide policy certainty in key economic sectors and aggressively implement policies aimed at stimulating growth and restoring consumer and business confidence. Confidence is critical in raising investment, employment and economic growth. The National Treasury is working to communicate government’s efforts to increase policy certainty to local and foreign business and investor communities, international financial institutions and the South African public. The National Treasury has been spearheading coordination with business, unions and government on key initiatives such as agriculture, tourism and the YES Initiative. It continues to look for opportunities to encourage dialogue between the public and private sectors. In addition, the National Treasury debates policy with sister departments through the cluster process. Leveraging resources to stimulate economic growth The National Treasury, the Department of Economic Development and other departments should work on a programme to mobilise resources behind actions that stimulate economic growth. This should include leveraging resources in public institutions that have strong balance sheets, including development finance institutions, the Unemployment Insurance Fund and metropolitan municipal councils. Page 7 of the 2016 Budget Review and pages 17-21 of the 2016 MTBPS identify key areas of intervention that are expected to stimulate growth. Some of the interventions are already being implemented and receiving funding. Key infrastructure projects, for example, will receive R947.2 billion in government funding over the medium term. Government is working with business and labour to build a foundation for faster growth. The Presidential Business Working Group and the CEO Initiative are working together to support the economy. Investments in energy, transport and telecommunications will be catalysts for growth. As the custodian of the New Growth Path, the Department of Economic Development is working with the Industrial Development Corporation to strengthen industrialisation by focusing on sectors that have significant potential for economic growth. About R60 billion has been set aside over the medium term and the highest portion of this capital will be allocated to priority value chains such as metals and mining, and agro-processing and agriculture. Linking medium-term spending proposals to government’s nine-point plan The Parliamentary Budget Office noted that the link between the medium-term spending proposals and the nine-point plan announced by government in the 2015 Budget Review are not obviously set out in the MTBPS.

The National Treasury could make a specific presentation available for the consideration of the committee should this be deemed necessary. Increasing allocations to economic services departments The committees recommend that the National Treasury increase the allocation to economic affairs and will refer this to the Appropriations Committee to consider how this could be done. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation. However, due to the constrained fiscal framework, the scope for increasing allocations in any cluster, including that of economic affairs, is limited. New priorities are being funded by reprioritising funds in existing departmental baselines. Should the fiscal framework improve, increasing allocations to the economic cluster may be considered. Effectiveness of government’s job-creation initiatives such as the Jobs Fund The committees recommend that the National Treasury evaluates the effectiveness of government’s job-creation initiatives, including the Jobs Fund, in reducing the high rate of unemployment and prepare a comprehensive report for the committees by the end of the first quarter of 2017.",

    "recommendation": "106 have been contracted with a grant allocation of R5.6 billion. As a result of this grant-funding project, partners have committed an additional R7.3 billion for job creation. These partners aim to deliver 136 069 new permanent sustainable jobs, place an additional 90 087 people into vacant positions and provide 224 089 training opportunities. The fund has gathered evidence on what works when designing programmes that accelerate the transition of unemployed women and youth from education to employment, and on successful enterprise development or business incubation programmes, including in the agricultural sector. Reskilling of laid-off workers in the mining and steel industries The committees recommend that the National Treasury give concerted attention to the Financial and Fiscal Commission’s view that short- to medium-term job-creation initiatives focus on reskilling laid-off workers in the mining and steel industries through the skills levy and streamlining job-creation schemes to focus on a few selected strategic sectors. The Unemployment Insurance Fund aims to prevent job losses and create conditions conducive for job retention in companies in distress through the Turnaround Solutions Programme implemented by Productivity SA. The training layoff scheme, financed by the National Skills Fund and the Unemployment Insurance Fund, is available to vulnerable workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs due to operational requirements. It is entered into voluntarily between the employer and affected employees. The scheme involves a temporary suspension of work so that workers can be sent for training. However, take-up has been poor. As a result, the department has simplified the procedures for accessing the scheme. The government is also providing incentives and programmes to create jobs. To date, the Expanded Public Works Programme has created 4.2 million jobs of various durations and the Jobs Fund has created 132 748 jobs. The manufacturing incentive programme under the Department of Trade and Industry has created and sustained 200 000 jobs since its inception. The community work programme under the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs is also expected to create 744 369 jobs of varied duration over the medium term. Increasing labour inspectors and the impact of the Expanded Public Works Programme on decent wages The committees recommend that the National Treasury give serious attention to the Congress of South African Trade Unions’ (COSATU’s) recommendation that more labour inspectors be appointed by the Department of Labour and COSATU’s concern regarding ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 123 the unintended consequences of the Expanded Public Works Programme, which it argues has become a source of cheap labour for cash-strapped municipalities and departments. The baseline for labour inspectors is increased by R54.5 million in the 2017 MTEF period. No reductions were made to the number of labour inspector posts so that the Department of Labour could remain within the compensation ceiling. The department has faced challenges in the past in retaining inspectors and finding suitably specialised candidates because of the higher salaries offered by the private sector. The Expanded Public Works Programme complies with the wage rates determined by the Department of Labour through the Minister of Labour’s determination. The national and provincial departments of public works therefore closely monitor the implementation of the Minister of Labour’s wage determination to ensure compliance. The balance between spending restraint and tax increases Government has rightly proposed that fiscal consolidation measures be balanced between spending restraint and tax increases. Government should ensure that the progressivity of the fiscal system is a key consideration in the tax measures to be proposed in the February Budget. As in previous years, the 2017 Budget proposes both limitations of expenditure and increases in tax revenue to consolidate public finances. Tax revenue will increase by R28 billion in 2017/18 and the revenue will be raised in a progressive manner, as the largest revenue increase will arise from changes to the personal income tax system. High-income earners will face the largest increase in their tax liabilities. The progressivity of the tax amendments was carefully considered, as shown through the publication of the distributional impact of the personal income tax tables in Chapter 4 of the 2017 Budget Review. Additional revenues will be sourced through increases in dividends withholding taxes, excise duties and the fuel levy. Shifting the composition of spending towards capital spending While continuing to limit the growth of consumption spending and contain expenditure on non-essential goods and services, government should strive to increase its allocations to investment and capital spending. The National Treasury should provide further detail on the proposed financing facility for social infrastructure when the Minister of Finance tables the Budget in February. Over the medium term, the total spending on infrastructure is R947.2 billion. Overall spending on infrastructure realises nominal growth of 4 per cent over the medium term. This confirms government’s commitment to spending on public infrastructure. The proposed new budget facility for infrastructure finance is a budget reform",

Government guarantees have increased substantially in recent years, and a large share of state-owned company debts are denominated in foreign currencies. In order to improve monitoring of these risks, the National Treasury should table a quarterly report in Parliament, providing updates on guarantees extended, the extent of exposure against guarantees and the data on the portfolio of state-owned company assets. The National Treasury has a review and monitoring process for managing the risks related to government guarantees issued to state-owned companies. In terms of the monitoring aspect of this process, a quarterly report outlining the movement in both the quality and volume of the guarantee portfolio is prepared and reported to the Fiscal Liabilities Committee and the Minister of Finance. This report should be able to satisfy the requirements of the committees and will be tabled in Parliament every quarter as recommended. The committees recommend that the National Treasury strengthens oversight over South African Airways (SAA) and other state-owned entities to prevent defaults, return it to profitability and reduce pressure on the national fiscus and national debt. The committees will seek to exercise more effective oversight over SAA.",

    "recommendation": "2017 BUDGET REVIEW 124 A new SAA board was appointed in September 2016. The Minister of Finance tasked the board with a number of actions and these have been receiving urgent attention. These activities included the finalisation of the annual financial statements for 2013/14 and 2014/15, both of which were concluded before the end of September 2016. SAA faces liquidity constraints in the short to medium term and government has been working closely with the board to address this, while working towards the long-term financial and commercial sustainability of the airline. With support from the National Treasury, SAA has secured funding to allow the board time to review and strengthen its turnaround plan, and take steps to stabilise the airline and return it to financial sustainability. The board is finalising the recruitment process for the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer positions so that recommendations can be submitted to the shareholder for consideration. The Minister of Finance has stressed to the SAA board that urgent action is required for the airline to operate sustainably. This includes the board reviewing and strengthening the airline's strategy to accelerate the turnaround and to ensure its robustness in the context of increasing competition and volatility in the fuel price and exchange rates. During this “business unusual” period, SAA will remain under intense government oversight through weekly, monthly and quarterly meetings. Measures to reduce lease costs The committees recommend that the National Treasury, working with the relevant departments, seeks to reduce the huge spending on leases of buildings and infrastructure. The Department of Public Works is considering ways to reduce lease costs. Application of the user-charge model, which has been developed by the Property Management Trading Entity, will enable the department to determine more accurately the cost of accommodation provided by the private sector, and use such knowledge as an instrument for negotiating more reasonable and affordable rentals. The department is also looking at providing accommodation using its own vast stock of immovable assets. Some of the buildings will need to be refurbished to bring them to the required standard for housing departments or entities, while in certain instances, like Statistics South Africa’s offices in Salvokop, new buildings will be constructed. Amendments to the Preferential Procurement Regulations The committees recommend that the National Treasury processes amendments to the Preferential Procurement Regulations speedily to ensure that previously disadvantaged groups and small, medium and micro enterprises benefit significantly. Progress on this should be provided regularly to the committees. The revised regulations were promulgated on 20 January 2017 and will be effective on 1 April 2017. The rollout of the revised regulations to practitioners, suppliers and oversight bodies such as parliamentary committees is still in the planning phase and is targeted for implementation from March 2017. Funding for post-school education The committees recommend that further allocations be considered for post-school education without prejudicing other key social programmes. The 2017 Budget provides for additional allocations to the higher education sector through internal reprioritisation and baseline reductions, so ensuring increased allocations without affecting key social programmes and compromising expenditure limits. Further allocations to post-school education will have to be considered during the 2018 Budget process by the Ministers’ Committee on the Budget. Achieving norms and standards for basic school infrastructure Equal Education is concerned that the 2016 MTBPS made no mention of basic school infrastructure and that there was insufficient funding to meet the norms and standards obligations. Equal Education suggests that the deadline of November 2016 might not be met. The committees recommend that the National Treasury respond to Equal Education’s concern about this, and its other proposals, and will refer Equal Education’s proposals to the Appropriations Committee. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 125 The November 2016 deadline was not met, but that was not due to a lack of funding. The problems in the rollout of the school infrastructure backlogs grant relate to poor performance by some implementing agents. There are difficulties in replacing underperformers with new contractors who are reluctant to “fix” previous contractors’ errors, and delays in finalising the merging and rationalisation of schools in the Eastern Cape. The National Treasury’s reply to this recommendation was sent to the Standing Committee on Appropriations through the 2016/17 second quarter expenditure report for the Department of Basic Education. Linking remuneration to performance in the public sector A critical element of containing consumption spending will be measures to limit the growth of compensation budgets. South Africa needs a stronger dialogue about performance and pay in the public sector. The DPSA, the National Treasury and the DPME should report jointly to Parliament before the middle of 2017 on the issues and concerns regarding performance, remuneration policy and pay. The National Treasury and the two departments are working on reforms for remuneration policy, performance and pay in the public service. Discussions with interested parties are taking place and a report will be tabled in Parliament. Compliance with instruction notes on cost containment The committees welcome the progress on cost containment but believe that more can be done. The committees also recommend that the National Treasury engages with the Auditor-General’s office to explore the possibility of the Auditor-General’s office conducting annual audits of the compliance of national and provincial departments, municipalities and public entities with cost- containment measures decided by the National Treasury and on reporting on these audits, which can be considered by parliamentary committees. The committees require the National Treasury to report on the possibilities of this at its first quarterly briefings of 2017. During September 2016, the National Treasury issued a revised Treasury Instruction on Cost Containment applicable to institutions that comply with the Public Finance Management Act (1999). This instruction aims to further reduce non-essential expenditure by introducing additional cost-containment measures, which include expenses on entertainment, advertising, newspapers and publications, and attendance at and the hosting of conferences. Cost-containment measures now cover more expenditure items. During April 2016, the National Treasury also issued a travel policy framework with measures to contain travel and accommodation costs. During November 2016, the National Treasury also issued a revised Circular on Cost-Containment Measures on travel and accommodation for institutions that comply with the Municipal Financial Management Act (2003). The National Treasury is drafting regulations on cost-containment measures for these municipal institutions. These regulations will contain, among others, those measures that are currently contained in the circulars. The National Treasury will engage the Auditor-General of South Africa on the possibility of including specific cost-containment expenditure items in annual audit plans. If agreement is reached on the items to be audited, the National Treasury will report annually to the committees on the outcomes of these audits. Feedback of the discussions with the Auditor-General of South Africa will be provided to the committees during the first quarterly briefings of 2017. Compensation limits, prioritisation of critical posts in the health sector and progress on the implementation of national health insurance In these difficult times, government’s commitment to sustain social spending is welcome. However, the committee notes rising pressure on social budgets, particularly in the health sector. The National Treasury and the Department of Health should review the impact of limits on compensation spending for critical services for the poor, and guidelines that help provincial and district health authorities manage more constrained budgets should be developed.",

    "recommendation": "that most of the budget cuts have been implemented in national departments and within provinces. Moderate cuts were made to the health budgets. The Minister of Finance and MECs for Finance have agreed that the health service staff should be protected while containing administrative personnel expenditure. Provinces have imposed restrictions on filling vacant posts, requiring all appointments, excluding health and education critical posts, to be approved by both the provincial treasury and the office of the premier. Only new vacant posts in health and education not budgeted for (particularly for new facilities) need the approval of the provincial treasuries and offices of the premier, because additional funding may be required. This will ensure that the provinces keep to the set ceilings without negatively affecting service delivery. The committees agree with COSATU’s concern about the impact of the moratorium placed on public service posts in the Department of Health and lack of detail in the MTBPS on progress made towards implementing national health insurance. The committees recommend that the National Treasury gives serious attention to COSATU’s concerns, and will also refer this to the Appropriations Committee. The National Treasury will manage the compensation budget and monitor it within the limited resources available. Service-delivery posts within the provincial departments of health are being protected by not filling non-critical or non-core posts, which ensures there is adequate funding. COSATU’s concerns are recognised and taken into account. It is important that service-delivery posts be funded to provide adequate services to the poor. With regards to the progress made on the implementation of national health insurance, the Department of Health is working closely with the National Treasury to address gaps in the insurance framework. Significant progress has been made in the following six work streams: • Establish the National Health Insurance Fund • Design and implement a national health insurance benefit package • Prepare for the purchaser-provider split • Explore the role of medical schemes under national health insurance • Complete policy papers for release for public comment and further analyses • Strengthen the district health system and governance. The National Treasury continues to support the implementation of national health insurance through the indirect national health insurance grant. Outreach programmes to members of the Government Employees Pension Fund The committees recommend that the National Treasury, the Government Employees Pension Fund and the Government Pensions Administrative Agency strengthen communication and public awareness campaigns to enable the members of government pension funds, including those in the rural areas, to easily access their benefits. The Government Employees Pension Fund and the Government Pensions Administrative Agency are combining communication initiatives to ensure their campaigns are more effective. The following communications and outreach programmes are in place: • National roadshows • Campaigns aimed at members who are about to retire • Quarterly newsletters for members and pensioners • Mobile offices in vans that go to rural areas to service and give information to members and pensioners • Media relations such as advisories and press releases • Exhibitions at government events such as Heritage Day celebrations • Departmental presentations on benefits and participation at union events • Client liaison officers who visit departments to assist with member queries • Workshops to equip human resources practitioners to assist members • Articles in stakeholder publications such as those of unions and departments.",

    "recommendation": "that will be affected by the reduction of the bucket eradication programme grant, as well as future plans for those projects. Municipalities with reduced indicative allocations were allocated funds in the 2016 Budget to account for these reductions. In some cases, the projects will cost less than expected by the end of 2016/17, allowing the funds to be shifted to projects elsewhere. Furthermore, there have been delays due to changes in the scope of work and technical challenges, such as the need to upgrade bulk supplies or drill through more rock than anticipated. In these cases, it will not be possible to spend the planned amounts in 2016/17, so the funds are reprioritised to other projects where they can be spent. The bucket eradication projects not completed by the end of 2016/17 will be funded and completed through the water services infrastructure grant and the regional bulk infrastructure grant in 2017/18. Details of which projects in each of these grants are supporting the completion of bucket eradication projects will be provided to Parliament during hearings on the 2017 Division of Revenue Bill. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and the conditional grant allocations to provincial and local spheres of government as contained in the 2016 MTBPS Monitoring of spending on capital projects The National Treasury should closely monitor spending on capital projects as well as provide guidance and support to sector departments and municipalities. The recommendation is supported. The National Treasury and sector departments provide extensive support for grant design and monitoring. In addition, the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent and sector departments have undertaken extensive work to ensure that municipalities have the capacity to map the infrastructure delivery cycle, which includes planning and making provision for infrastructure maintenance, repairs and replacement. Review of the provincial equitable share formula The National Treasury should ensure that the review process of the provincial equitable share formula, where applicable, factors in some of the concerns raised by provinces. The recommendation is supported. The formula is being reviewed to determine whether its components remain responsive to the country's realities. Provincial treasuries form part of this task team and have raised the matters that are of importance to them. Reduction of allocations to provincial and local government grants The National Treasury should ensure that the proposed reductions in allocations to a number of provincial infrastructure grants do not compromise the NDP targets as expressed within the medium-term strategic framework. That is, the provision of an efficient, competitive and responsive economic infrastructure network. Furthermore, the National Treasury should ensure that the reduction and reprioritisation of funds do not compromise the long-term development goals as outlined in the NDP and should ensure",

    "recommendation": "5 per cent per year over the 2017 MTEF period. Prioritising basic services in local government The National Treasury and municipalities should ensure that the funds added to the local government equitable share are used as planned. That is, to offset the cost pressures of bulk water and electricity. Section 227 of the Constitution specifies that local government is “entitled to an equitable share of revenue raised nationally to enable it to provide basic services and perform the functions allocated to it”. The local government equitable share is therefore an unconditional allocation. However, Section 153 of the Constitution states that a municipality must manage its administration and budgeting and planning processes to give priority to the basic needs of the community. Municipalities are therefore expected to prioritise the provision of free basic services in their budgets. The National Treasury and provincial treasuries will ensure that this happens through budget benchmarking processes with municipalities. Review of the local government equitable share formula The announced plans to update the local government equitable share formula with the 2016 Community Survey data should be applied in such a manner that it has minimal negative impact on certain municipalities. The release of the 2016 Community Survey provided an opportunity to update the household numbers in the formula using the most recent data. The current model for estimating household numbers has proven to be broadly consistent with the Community Survey results in most cases. However, few municipalities will experience significant changes in their allocations as a result of these updates. The Budget Forum has endorsed a three-year phase-in to minimise the impact of allocation changes to these municipalities. In 2017/18, all municipalities are guaranteed to receive at least 95 per cent of the indicative allocation for the equitable share published in the 2016 division of revenue. Improving the delivery of electrification and other basic services in metropolitan municipalities The National Treasury should ensure that coordination between the delivery of electrification and other basic services is improved in cities by incorporating the integrated national electrification programme (municipal) grant allocations for metros into the urban settlements development grant. This recommendation is supported. The National Treasury will work with the Department of Energy and the Department of Human Settlements on incorporating the integrated national electrification programme (municipal) grant allocations for metropolitan municipalities into the urban settlements development grant for 2018/19. Recommendations of the Select and Standing Committees on Finance on the 2016 Revised Fiscal Framework Managing the refinancing of maturing debt The committees note that a significant amount of long-term government debt will start to mature in 2018/19 and recommend that the National Treasury plans effectively for that and reports to committees at the 2017 MTBPS. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 121 In planning for the maturing debt over the period 2017/18 to 2020/21, the National Treasury introduced a bond- switch programme in 2014/15, exchanging shorter dated debt (bonds maturing over the period 2017/18 to 2020/21) for longer dated debt to address the high refinancing risk to the government debt portfolio. Of the R404.2 billion that was outstanding in maturing debt as at February 2015, R130.4 billion has been exchanged as at January 2017. In addition to the budgeted cash for repayment of maturing debt, the National Treasury will continue with the bond-switch auction programme to manage the refinancing of maturing debt. Strengthening the social pact to improve economic growth While recognising the difficulties, the committees recommend that the National Treasury and government as a whole intensify efforts at cooperation between government, Parliament, the private sector, trade unions and civil society to improve economic growth and create jobs. The National Treasury supports the recommendation. Building cooperation between government, Parliament, the private sector, trade unions and civil society is a critical part of inclusive economic growth. The National Treasury continues to support and engage with such efforts wherever possible. Increasing policy certainty in key sectors of the economy The committees recommend that the National Treasury and government as a whole provide policy certainty in key economic sectors and aggressively implement policies aimed at stimulating growth and restoring consumer and business confidence. Confidence is critical in raising investment, employment and economic growth. The National Treasury is working to communicate government’s efforts to increase policy certainty to local and foreign business and investor communities, international financial institutions and the South African public. The National Treasury has been spearheading coordination with business, unions and government on key initiatives such as agriculture, tourism and the YES Initiative. It continues to look for opportunities to encourage dialogue between the public and private sectors. In addition, the National Treasury debates policy with sister departments through the cluster process. Leveraging resources to stimulate economic growth The National Treasury, the Department of Economic Development and other departments should work on a programme to mobilise resources behind actions that stimulate economic growth. This should include leveraging resources in public institutions that have strong balance sheets, including development finance institutions, the Unemployment Insurance Fund and metropolitan municipal councils. Page 7 of the 2016 Budget Review and pages 17-21 of the 2016 MTBPS identify key areas of intervention that are expected to stimulate growth. Some of the interventions are already being implemented and receiving funding. Key infrastructure projects, for example, will receive R947.2 billion in government funding over the medium term. Government is working with business and labour to build a foundation for faster growth. The Presidential Business Working Group and the CEO Initiative are working together to support the economy. Investments in energy, transport and telecommunications will be catalysts for growth. As the custodian of the New Growth Path, the Department of Economic Development is working with the Industrial Development Corporation to strengthen industrialisation by focusing on sectors that have significant potential for economic growth. About R60 billion has been set aside over the medium term and the highest portion of this capital will be allocated to priority value chains such as metals and mining, and agro-processing and agriculture. Linking medium-term spending proposals to government’s nine-point plan The Parliamentary Budget Office noted that the link between the medium-term spending proposals and the nine-point plan announced by government in the 2015 Budget Review are not obviously set out in the MTBPS.

The NDP and the medium-term strategic framework provide the broad framework in which budget allocations are made. Nevertheless, links with the nine-point plan, which is integrated into government policy planning, should also be clear. The National Treasury could make a specific presentation available for the consideration of the committee should this be deemed necessary. Increasing allocations to economic services departments The committees recommend that the National Treasury increase the allocation to economic affairs and will refer this to the Appropriations Committee to consider how this could be done. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation. However, due to the constrained fiscal framework, the scope for increasing allocations in any cluster, including that of economic affairs, is limited. New priorities are being funded by reprioritising funds in existing departmental baselines. Should the fiscal framework improve, increasing allocations to the economic cluster may be considered. Effectiveness of government’s job-creation initiatives such as the Jobs Fund The committees recommend that the National Treasury evaluates the effectiveness of government’s job-creation initiatives, including the Jobs Fund, in reducing the high rate of unemployment and prepare a comprehensive report for the committees by the end of the first quarter of 2017.",

    "recommendation": "106 have been contracted with a grant allocation of R5.6 billion. As a result of this grant-funding project, partners have committed an additional R7.3 billion for job creation. These partners aim to deliver 136 069 new permanent sustainable jobs, place an additional 90 087 people into vacant positions and provide 224 089 training opportunities. The fund has gathered evidence on what works when designing programmes that accelerate the transition of unemployed women and youth from education to employment, and on successful enterprise development or business incubation programmes, including in the agricultural sector. Reskilling of laid-off workers in the mining and steel industries The committees recommend that the National Treasury give concerted attention to the Financial and Fiscal Commission’s view that short- to medium-term job-creation initiatives focus on reskilling laid-off workers in the mining and steel industries through the skills levy and streamlining job-creation schemes to focus on a few selected strategic sectors. The Unemployment Insurance Fund aims to prevent job losses and create conditions conducive for job retention in companies in distress through the Turnaround Solutions Programme implemented by Productivity SA. The training layoff scheme, financed by the National Skills Fund and the Unemployment Insurance Fund, is available to vulnerable workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs due to operational requirements. It is entered into voluntarily between the employer and affected employees. The scheme involves a temporary suspension of work so that workers can be sent for training. However, take-up has been poor. As a result, the department has simplified the procedures for accessing the scheme. The government is also providing incentives and programmes to create jobs. To date, the Expanded Public Works Programme has created 4.2 million jobs of various durations and the Jobs Fund has created 132 748 jobs. The manufacturing incentive programme under the Department of Trade and Industry has created and sustained 200 000 jobs since its inception. The community work programme under the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs is also expected to create 744 369 jobs of varied duration over the medium term. Increasing labour inspectors and the impact of the Expanded Public Works Programme on decent wages The committees recommend that the National Treasury give serious attention to the Congress of South African Trade Unions’ (COSATU’s) recommendation that more labour inspectors be appointed by the Department of Labour and COSATU’s concern regarding ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 123 the unintended consequences of the Expanded Public Works Programme, which it argues has become a source of cheap labour for cash-strapped municipalities and departments. The baseline for labour inspectors is increased by R54.5 million in the 2017 MTEF period. No reductions were made to the number of labour inspector posts so that the Department of Labour could remain within the compensation ceiling. The department has faced challenges in the past in retaining inspectors and finding suitably specialised candidates because of the higher salaries offered by the private sector. The Expanded Public Works Programme complies with the wage rates determined by the Department of Labour through the Minister of Labour’s determination. The national and provincial departments of public works therefore closely monitor the implementation of the Minister of Labour’s wage determination to ensure compliance. The balance between spending restraint and tax increases Government has rightly proposed that fiscal consolidation measures be balanced between spending restraint and tax increases. Government should ensure that the progressivity of the fiscal system is a key consideration in the tax measures to be proposed in the February Budget. As in previous years, the 2017 Budget proposes both limitations of expenditure and increases in tax revenue to consolidate public finances. Tax revenue will increase by R28 billion in 2017/18 and the revenue will be raised in a progressive manner, as the largest revenue increase will arise from changes to the personal income tax system. High-income earners will face the largest increase in their tax liabilities. The progressivity of the tax amendments was carefully considered, as shown through the publication of the distributional impact of the personal income tax tables in Chapter 4 of the 2017 Budget Review. Additional revenues will be sourced through increases in dividends withholding taxes, excise duties and the fuel levy. Shifting the composition of spending towards capital spending While continuing to limit the growth of consumption spending and contain expenditure on non-essential goods and services, government should strive to increase its allocations to investment and capital spending. The National Treasury should provide further detail on the proposed financing facility for social infrastructure when the Minister of Finance tables the Budget in February. Over the medium term, the total spending on infrastructure is R947.2 billion. Overall spending on infrastructure realises nominal growth of 4 per cent over the medium term. This confirms government’s commitment to spending on public infrastructure. The proposed new budget facility for infrastructure finance is a budget reform",

Measures to reduce lease costs The committees recommend that the National Treasury, working with the relevant departments, seeks to reduce the huge spending on leases of buildings and infrastructure. The Department of Public Works is considering ways to reduce lease costs. Application of the user-charge model, which has been developed by the Property Management Trading Entity, will enable the department to determine more accurately the cost of accommodation provided by the private sector, and use such knowledge as an instrument for negotiating more reasonable and affordable rentals. The department is also looking at providing accommodation using its own vast stock of immovable assets.

Progress on this should be provided regularly to the committees. The revised regulations were promulgated on 20 January 2017 and will be effective on 1 April 2017. The rollout of the revised regulations to practitioners, suppliers and oversight bodies such as parliamentary committees is still in the planning phase and is targeted for implementation from March 2017.

The 2017 Budget provides for additional allocations to the higher education sector through internal reprioritisation and baseline reductions, so ensuring increased allocations without affecting key social programmes and compromising expenditure limits. Further allocations to post-school education will have to be considered during the 2018 Budget process by the Ministers’ Committee on the Budget. Achieving norms and standards for basic school infrastructure Equal Education is concerned that the 2016 MTBPS made no mention of basic school infrastructure and that there was insufficient funding to meet the norms and standards obligations. Equal Education suggests that the deadline of November 2016 might not be met. The committees recommend that the National Treasury respond to Equal Education’s concern about this, and its other proposals, and will refer Equal Education’s proposals to the Appropriations Committee. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 125 The November 2016 deadline was not met, but that was not due to a lack of funding. The problems in the rollout of the school infrastructure backlogs grant relate to poor performance by some implementing agents. There are difficulties in replacing underperformers with new contractors who are reluctant to “fix” previous contractors’ errors, and delays in finalising the merging and rationalisation of schools in the Eastern Cape. The National Treasury’s reply to this recommendation was sent to the Standing Committee on Appropriations through the 2016/17 second quarter expenditure report for the Department of Basic Education. Linking remuneration to performance in the public sector A critical element of containing consumption spending will be measures to limit the growth of compensation budgets. South Africa needs a stronger dialogue about performance and pay in the public sector. The DPSA, the National Treasury and the DPME should report jointly to Parliament before the middle of 2017 on the issues and concerns regarding performance, remuneration policy and pay. The National Treasury and the two departments are working on reforms for remuneration policy, performance and pay in the public service. Discussions with interested parties are taking place and a report will be tabled in Parliament. Compliance with instruction notes on cost containment The committees welcome the progress on cost containment but believe that more can be done. The committees also recommend that the National Treasury engages with the Auditor-General’s office to explore the possibility of the Auditor-General’s office conducting annual audits of the compliance of national and provincial departments, municipalities and public entities with cost- containment measures decided by the National Treasury and on reporting on these audits, which can be considered by parliamentary committees. The committees require the National Treasury to report on the possibilities of this at its first quarterly briefings of 2017. During September 2016, the National Treasury issued a revised Treasury Instruction on Cost Containment applicable to institutions that comply with the Public Finance Management Act (1999). This instruction aims to further reduce non-essential expenditure by introducing additional cost-containment measures, which include expenses on entertainment, advertising, newspapers and publications, and attendance at and the hosting of conferences. Cost-containment measures now cover more expenditure items. During April 2016, the National Treasury also issued a travel policy framework with measures to contain travel and accommodation costs. During November 2016, the National Treasury also issued a revised Circular on Cost-Containment Measures on travel and accommodation for institutions that comply with the Municipal Financial Management Act (2003). The National Treasury is drafting regulations on cost-containment measures for these municipal institutions. These regulations will contain, among others, those measures that are currently contained in the circulars. The National Treasury will engage the Auditor-General of South Africa on the possibility of including specific cost-containment expenditure items in annual audit plans. If agreement is reached on the items to be audited, the National Treasury will report annually to the committees on the outcomes of these audits. Feedback of the discussions with the Auditor-General of South Africa will be provided to the committees during the first quarterly briefings of 2017. Compensation limits, prioritisation of critical posts in the health sector and progress on the implementation of national health insurance In these difficult times, government’s commitment to sustain social spending is welcome. However, the committee notes rising pressure on social budgets, particularly in the health sector. The National Treasury and the Department of Health should review the impact of limits on compensation spending for critical services for the poor, and guidelines that help provincial and district health authorities manage more constrained budgets should be developed.",

    "recommendation": "that most of the budget cuts have been implemented in national departments and within provinces. Moderate cuts were made to the health budgets. The Minister of Finance and MECs for Finance have agreed that the health service staff should be protected while containing administrative personnel expenditure. Provinces have imposed restrictions on filling vacant posts, requiring all appointments, excluding health and education critical posts, to be approved by both the provincial treasury and the office of the premier. Only new vacant posts in health and education not budgeted for (particularly for new facilities) need the approval of the provincial treasuries and offices of the premier, because additional funding may be required. This will ensure that the provinces keep to the set ceilings without negatively affecting service delivery. The committees agree with COSATU’s concern about the impact of the moratorium placed on public service posts in the Department of Health and lack of detail in the MTBPS on progress made towards implementing national health insurance. The committees recommend that the National Treasury gives serious attention to COSATU’s concerns, and will also refer this to the Appropriations Committee. The National Treasury will manage the compensation budget and monitor it within the limited resources available. Service-delivery posts within the provincial departments of health are being protected by not filling non-critical or non-core posts, which ensures there is adequate funding. COSATU’s concerns are recognised and taken into account. It is important that service-delivery posts be funded to provide adequate services to the poor. With regards to the progress made on the implementation of national health insurance, the Department of Health is working closely with the National Treasury to address gaps in the insurance framework. Significant progress has been made in the following six work streams: • Establish the National Health Insurance Fund • Design and implement a national health insurance benefit package • Prepare for the purchaser-provider split • Explore the role of medical schemes under national health insurance • Complete policy papers for release for public comment and further analyses • Strengthen the district health system and governance. The National Treasury continues to support the implementation of national health insurance through the indirect national health insurance grant. Outreach programmes to members of the Government Employees Pension Fund The committees recommend that the National Treasury, the Government Employees Pension Fund and the Government Pensions Administrative Agency strengthen communication and public awareness campaigns to enable the members of government pension funds, including those in the rural areas, to easily access their benefits. The Government Employees Pension Fund and the Government Pensions Administrative Agency are combining communication initiatives to ensure their campaigns are more effective. The following communications and outreach programmes are in place: • National roadshows • Campaigns aimed at members who are about to retire • Quarterly newsletters for members and pensioners • Mobile offices in vans that go to rural areas to service and give information to members and pensioners • Media relations such as advisories and press releases • Exhibitions at government events such as Heritage Day celebrations • Departmental presentations on benefits and participation at union events • Client liaison officers who visit departments to assist with member queries • Workshops to equip human resources practitioners to assist members • Articles in stakeholder publications such as those of unions and departments.",

Some committees also recommended that additional budget allocations be made available for particular programmes, sub-programmes or other budget items. However, the scope for additional funding is limited given the constrained fiscal outlook. Departments, public entities and constitutional institutions were required to reprioritise funds within their existing baselines to fund new priorities. Should the fiscal outlook improve, recommendations for additional funding may be considered in future budget processes. The rest of this report details the Minister of Finance’s response to matters contained in the other committee reports. Where different reports make the same recommendations, responses have not been repeated. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the 2016 MTBPS Identification of programmes at risk with regards to budget execution The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME), develops systems and mechanisms targeted at identifying those programmes and spending areas that are most at risk with regards to budget execution. These identified programmes and spending areas are to be submitted to the committee. The DPME is leading government’s effort to evaluate programmes. The National Treasury works closely with the DPME to identify programmes and spending areas that are at risk in respect of budget execution. A full presentation will be available for the committee’s consideration during the course of 2017. Guidelines to contain personnel costs without affecting service delivery The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) and the DPME, develops comprehensive cost-containment guidelines targeted at national and provincial departments of education and health, ensuring that posts for critical staff are protected in relation to service-delivery requirements, payroll management is effective, and that all districts have costed human resource plans and innovative methodologies to contain costs without compromising service delivery. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 Departments have prepared human resource budget plans indicating critical posts that have to be funded. Mechanisms for exiting non-critical posts such as employee-initiated severance packages are available within the current public service regulations, to implement where necessary. In some provinces, premiers’ offices have taken control of payroll management. Provinces have been encouraged to budget adequately for health personnel, particularly for occupation-specific dispensation posts. Provinces have imposed restrictions on filling vacant posts, requiring all appointments, excluding health and education critical posts, to be approved by both the provincial treasury and the office of the premier. The National Treasury agrees with the need to identify and protect critical posts, especially in areas where access to healthcare is already limited. In principle, the National Treasury believes that the prioritisation of posts is best done locally, and will continue to engage with the Department of Health and the Department of Education, and provincial treasuries, to find ways to manage budget pressures and to provide guidance on the best approach for critical posts in the context of constrained budgets. The Minister of Finance and MECs for Finance have agreed that health service staff should be protected while containing administrative personnel expenditure. Only new vacant posts in health and education not budgeted for (particularly for new facilities) need the approval of the provincial treasuries and offices of the premier, because additional funding may be required. This will ensure that provinces keep to the set expenditure ceilings without negatively affecting service delivery. Aligning resource planning with the NDP The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury develops and publishes a long-term fiscal report that spans the timeframes outlined in the NDP. This will assist the country in aligning resource planning towards long-term fiscal sustainability. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The intention is to expand the Fiscal Risk Statement (to be published as part of the 2017 MTBPS in October) to include more detail on the long-term fiscal outlook. As suggested by the committee, this will span the timeframes outlined in the NDP. The impact of infrastructure projects on communities The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with Statistics South Africa and the DPME, develops indicators that will assist national and provincial departments and state-owned entities to track the impact of infrastructure programmes on communities, including jobs and economic participation. These should assist in detecting challenges early to allow for rapid remedial response. The National Treasury agrees to a coordinated approach with Statistics South Africa and the DPME to improve the indicators used to track the impact of service delivery related to infrastructure. Statistics South Africa has established a system with readily available data based on community surveys and other statistics that it collates and reports. Well-designed monitoring frameworks should include performance indicators at input, activity, output and outcome levels to ensure that departments are able to monitor progress on policy objectives. The National Treasury will continue to support departments and public entities in refining monitoring frameworks to ensure that government objectives are consistently tracked and reported. Outreach programmes on the use of reporting systems The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with the DPME, embarks on education outreach programmes to all departments and state entities on the use and access to rich datasets contained in the prevailing systems of government such as, though not limited to, the Basic Accounting System and PERSAL.",

    "recommendation": "2017 BUDGET REVIEW 114 A National Treasury survey on the use of systems for reporting purposes found that a high percentage of the sampled respondents did not know how to use reporting systems such as the Vulindlela Management Information System. This system provides access to the datasets contained in all the transversal transactional systems of government. Departments tend to use the Basic Accounting System, which is the main transactional system, for reporting. Budgets allowing, departments would benefit from extending their use to include the rest of the available systems for their reporting. The move to an integrated financial management system will have a long-term effect. Implementing the system will require substantial adjustments and the retraining of data users, which will provide an opportunity to educate users and managers on the use of data from the various financial systems. Growth-enhancing initiatives The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury and the DPME, together with relevant stakeholders, cascade best practice in economic growth-enhancing initiatives and partnership models such as the Invest SA One Stop Shop, the CEO Initiative and the Presidential Business Working Group to provincial and local spheres of government. An extensive programme of engagement with local and provincial government on the ease of doing business is under way. It includes work with the Department of Trade and Industry, the Government Technical Advisory Centre and the World Bank to disseminate best practice on how local government should work. The Department of Trade and Industry is the lead department in the Invest SA One Stop Shop initiative. The National Treasury is ready to support it in any way possible. The CEO Initiative has focused on national programmes. The National Treasury will share lessons learnt with the other spheres of government. A report on the suggestions from business will be shared with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs for dissemination. Instruction note on cost containment for major infrastructure projects The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury considers formulating and developing cost-control instruction notes for all major infrastructure programmes of government, similar to the newly developed cost-control instruction notes governing school construction. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer issued an instruction note in 2015. The note gave effect to cost- control measures for the construction of new primary and secondary schools and the provision of additional buildings at existing schools.

Cost-containment measures for foreign missions The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury considers formulating and developing special cost-control instruction notes for all foreign missions and immediately embarks on a comprehensive reprioritisation drive in South Africa’s foreign missions. The National Treasury will issue an instruction note to departments operating foreign missions. During the 2017 Budget process, the National Treasury has engaged with the Department of International Relations and Cooperation on the possible rationalisation of foreign missions and related costs. Over the medium term, the department has committed to implementing various initiatives, such as rescheduling existing foreign infrastructure projects, reviewing the foreign service dispensation, reducing voluntary membership fee contributions, and rationalising locally recruited personnel in foreign missions. Consequently, R183.6 million will be reprioritised from various goods and services items and payments for capital assets over the medium term.

A public financial management portal has been designed and is being implemented to provide a platform for knowledge and information sharing, networking and learning. Relations with the relevant sector education and training authorities are being strengthened to ensure strategic alignment, funding and delivery of priority programmes. A draft business case on professionalising financial management and a draft framework for financial management education and training have been developed for consultation. Introducing cost-containment targets into resource planning The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, in partnership with the DPME, considers the inclusion of comprehensive cost-containment targets in resource planning and budgeting frameworks to ensure enhanced emphasis of cost-containment principles in the implementation of government programmes.

    "recommendation": "2017 BUDGET REVIEW 116 The Department of Public Works has embarked on several initiatives to facilitate improvements in the management of government property. The department, through its Property Management Trading Entity, is finalising and verifying its asset register, which has begun to provide a more accurate account of the number of buildings or immovable assets in its portfolio. The trading entity has developed a user-charge model, which will enable the department to determine the real costs of providing government accommodation. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, together with the Property Management Trading Entity, did a comparative analysis in 2015/16 of rentals paid by government versus market-related rentals. The sector has also been made aware of the reforms on procurement as well as government’s implementation of a new framework for leasing procurement. Talks have started with holders of large portfolios and landlords to renegotiate leases. A new property empowerment policy is being developed and a property management and leasing framework has been developed. The standard for leasing and letting for the public sector is expected to be issued by 1 April 2017 for use across government. The National Treasury will continue to support the Department of Public Works and the Property Management Trading Entity in their work to introduce more effective and efficient asset management practices that could unlock the vast and underexploited economic potential in government’s immovable asset portfolio. Earmarking of funds for early childhood development programmes The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury puts in place measures to ensure that funds earmarked for early childhood development (ECD) programmes are used only for that specific purpose and prioritise emphasis on the quality of the programme directed at concrete efforts at foundational learning and teaching. Provincial departments of education are responsible for the delivery of Grade R. Provincial departments of social development are responsible for ECD for children aged 0-4 years old. Each provincial department of education and social development has an ECD budget programme that funds components of ECD. Provincial treasuries have an oversight role and monitor spending on a monthly basis and link spending to the objectives. The new early childhood development grant coming into effect in 2017/18 will enable the Department of Social Development to ring-fence funds for the expansion of ECD and to facilitate compliance with the National Integrated Early Childhood Development Policy. Provinces will not be able to use conditional grant funding to replace funding for items that they have previously allocated to ECD subsidies. This ensures that any investment provinces have made in ECD in the past remains within the ECD budget. If a child is subsidised in one year, the place that child holds will continue to be subsidised indefinitely – the number of children subsidised will not decrease. Part of the Department of Social Development’s responsibilities under the new conditional grant will be to develop a standardised reporting framework and monitoring tool for the grant and to take appropriate action in cases of non-compliance with the conditional grant framework. The importance of inclusive economic growth The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders develop and roll out a detailed programme identifying all factors needed for the attainment of inclusive growth and incorporate these into dialogues with legislatures, departments and other role players so as to outline concrete steps that need to be taken and to emphasise the importance of inclusive economic growth as a necessary condition to support radical social and economic transformation. The National Treasury is developing a detailed plan for these key factors, which it will share with the National Planning Commission, the DPME, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Economic Development for careful consideration to inform the development of inclusive growth strategies. Timely payment of teachers and nurses The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury puts in place measures to ensure that payments for personnel in critical positions such as teachers, nurses and all other school and hospital staff are timeous and adhere to agreed employment contracts. No teacher or nurse should be unpaid following the rendering of services. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 The government relies on a payroll and personnel management system called PERSAL. The system is well maintained and programmed to release payments to staff promptly. Provinces have to ensure that correct and adequate information is captured on the system on time. There are specialised units within the National Treasury, the DPSA and the State Information Technology Agency that ensure that PERSAL is working well to avoid non-payment of staff. Social and behavioural change programmes to reduce non-communicable diseases The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, together with the Department of Health, considers ways of leveraging resources within available funds for the provision of social and behavioural change programmes. This will highlight the importance of good nutrition, especially in children and poor communities, so as to reduce the prevalence of non-communicable diseases. This should have a positive effect on quality of life trajectories of children, especially in rural and disadvantaged communities. The Minister of Finance announced in the 2016 Budget the decision to introduce a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages to address obesity and the non-communicable disease burden in South Africa. The National Treasury is committed to working with the Department of Health to support initiatives alongside the sugar tax to decrease the incidence of obesity and non-communicable diseases. Decreasing the public’s preference and demand for unhealthy food products through education, and detecting and preventing non-communicable diseases, are critical to reducing obesity. The Department of Health’s integrated school health programme promotes healthy habits among school children. Reprioritisation of funds within the Department of Communications The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury, together with the Department of Communications, embarks on a comprehensive reprioritisation programme within the Department of Communications’ portfolio so as to realise efficiencies and leverage savings towards the funding of the Department of Communications in the areas of basic office infrastructure and critical personnel support services and critical programmes such as the digital terrestrial television project. The Department of Communications and the National Treasury have embarked on a reprioritisation exercise to fund critical personnel support services and the digital terrestrial television project. As a result, R32 million has been reprioritised from the transfer payments to the South African Broadcasting Corporation over the medium term. The National Treasury, the Department of Communications and the Department of Public Works are looking at the accommodation requirements for the Department of Communications to determine the funding requirements for office accommodation.

Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the 2016 Adjustments Appropriation Bill Linking financial and non-financial information in expenditure reports The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation should ensure that the National Treasury and the DPME consider developing and implementing systems for the compilation of consolidated quarterly reports combining financial and non- financial performance and present these jointly to the committee. The National Treasury is reviewing the formats of the monthly and quarterly reports and will involve the DPME in the review process. Alignment of budget and strategic planning within the National Treasury The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury aligns and enhances its budget planning and strategic planning function to ensure that annual performance plans align with programme budget allocations. The National Treasury recognises the importance of coordinating and integrating planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring functions. It continues to strengthen strategic planning and budgeting mechanisms. It works closely with the DPME to improve strategic planning capabilities within government and ensure that the sequencing of planning and budgeting is aligned, and performance reporting is enhanced to promote evidence-based decision making.

To ensure that service delivery is not negatively affected by this decision, a recruitment committee chaired by the Director-General was established. This committee meets regularly to assess all current vacancies and approve critical posts that need to be filled urgently. All the approved critical posts have been filled promptly, with a turnaround time of between four and five weeks, and a vacancy rate of 1.5 per cent as at 31 December 2016. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the 2016 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill In-year revision of conditional grant frameworks The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury effects the proposed corrections to the conditional grant frameworks that were submitted together with the bill, in accordance with section 16(4) of the Division of Revenue Act (2016). The corrections were implemented as recommended by Parliament.",

Municipalities with reduced indicative allocations were allocated funds in the 2016 Budget to account for these reductions. In some cases, the projects will cost less than expected by the end of 2016/17, allowing the funds to be shifted to projects elsewhere. Furthermore, there have been delays due to changes in the scope of work and technical challenges, such as the need to upgrade bulk supplies or drill through more rock than anticipated. In these cases, it will not be possible to spend the planned amounts in 2016/17, so the funds are reprioritised to other projects where they can be spent. The bucket eradication projects not completed by the end of 2016/17 will be funded and completed through the water services infrastructure grant and the regional bulk infrastructure grant in 2017/18. Details of which projects in each of these grants are supporting the completion of bucket eradication projects will be provided to Parliament during hearings on the 2017 Division of Revenue Bill. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and the conditional grant allocations to provincial and local spheres of government as contained in the 2016 MTBPS Monitoring of spending on capital projects The National Treasury should closely monitor spending on capital projects as well as provide guidance and support to sector departments and municipalities. The recommendation is supported. The National Treasury and sector departments provide extensive support for grant design and monitoring. In addition, the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent and sector departments have undertaken extensive work to ensure that municipalities have the capacity to map the infrastructure delivery cycle, which includes planning and making provision for infrastructure maintenance, repairs and replacement. Review of the provincial equitable share formula The National Treasury should ensure that the review process of the provincial equitable share formula, where applicable, factors in some of the concerns raised by provinces. The recommendation is supported. The formula is being reviewed to determine whether its components remain responsive to the country's realities. Provincial treasuries form part of this task team and have raised the matters that are of importance to them. Reduction of allocations to provincial and local government grants The National Treasury should ensure that the proposed reductions in allocations to a number of provincial infrastructure grants do not compromise the NDP targets as expressed within the medium-term strategic framework. That is, the provision of an efficient, competitive and responsive economic infrastructure network. Furthermore, the National Treasury should ensure that the reduction and reprioritisation of funds do not compromise the long-term development goals as outlined in the NDP and should ensure",

    "recommendation": "5 per cent per year over the 2017 MTEF period. Prioritising basic services in local government The National Treasury and municipalities should ensure that the funds added to the local government equitable share are used as planned. That is, to offset the cost pressures of bulk water and electricity. Section 227 of the Constitution specifies that local government is “entitled to an equitable share of revenue raised nationally to enable it to provide basic services and perform the functions allocated to it”. The local government equitable share is therefore an unconditional allocation. However, Section 153 of the Constitution states that a municipality must manage its administration and budgeting and planning processes to give priority to the basic needs of the community. Municipalities are therefore expected to prioritise the provision of free basic services in their budgets. The National Treasury and provincial treasuries will ensure that this happens through budget benchmarking processes with municipalities. Review of the local government equitable share formula The announced plans to update the local government equitable share formula with the 2016 Community Survey data should be applied in such a manner that it has minimal negative impact on certain municipalities. The release of the 2016 Community Survey provided an opportunity to update the household numbers in the formula using the most recent data. The current model for estimating household numbers has proven to be broadly consistent with the Community Survey results in most cases. However, few municipalities will experience significant changes in their allocations as a result of these updates. The Budget Forum has endorsed a three-year phase-in to minimise the impact of allocation changes to these municipalities. In 2017/18, all municipalities are guaranteed to receive at least 95 per cent of the indicative allocation for the equitable share published in the 2016 division of revenue. Improving the delivery of electrification and other basic services in metropolitan municipalities The National Treasury should ensure that coordination between the delivery of electrification and other basic services is improved in cities by incorporating the integrated national electrification programme (municipal) grant allocations for metros into the urban settlements development grant. This recommendation is supported. The National Treasury will work with the Department of Energy and the Department of Human Settlements on incorporating the integrated national electrification programme (municipal) grant allocations for metropolitan municipalities into the urban settlements development grant for 2018/19. Recommendations of the Select and Standing Committees on Finance on the 2016 Revised Fiscal Framework Managing the refinancing of maturing debt The committees note that a significant amount of long-term government debt will start to mature in 2018/19 and recommend that the National Treasury plans effectively for that and reports to committees at the 2017 MTBPS. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 121 In planning for the maturing debt over the period 2017/18 to 2020/21, the National Treasury introduced a bond- switch programme in 2014/15, exchanging shorter dated debt (bonds maturing over the period 2017/18 to 2020/21) for longer dated debt to address the high refinancing risk to the government debt portfolio. Of the R404.2 billion that was outstanding in maturing debt as at February 2015, R130.4 billion has been exchanged as at January 2017. In addition to the budgeted cash for repayment of maturing debt, the National Treasury will continue with the bond-switch auction programme to manage the refinancing of maturing debt. Strengthening the social pact to improve economic growth While recognising the difficulties, the committees recommend that the National Treasury and government as a whole intensify efforts at cooperation between government, Parliament, the private sector, trade unions and civil society to improve economic growth and create jobs. The National Treasury supports the recommendation. Building cooperation between government, Parliament, the private sector, trade unions and civil society is a critical part of inclusive economic growth. The National Treasury continues to support and engage with such efforts wherever possible. Increasing policy certainty in key sectors of the economy The committees recommend that the National Treasury and government as a whole provide policy certainty in key economic sectors and aggressively implement policies aimed at stimulating growth and restoring consumer and business confidence. Confidence is critical in raising investment, employment and economic growth. The National Treasury is working to communicate government’s efforts to increase policy certainty to local and foreign business and investor communities, international financial institutions and the South African public. The National Treasury has been spearheading coordination with business, unions and government on key initiatives such as agriculture, tourism and the YES Initiative. It continues to look for opportunities to encourage dialogue between the public and private sectors. In addition, the National Treasury debates policy with sister departments through the cluster process. Leveraging resources to stimulate economic growth The National Treasury, the Department of Economic Development and other departments should work on a programme to mobilise resources behind actions that stimulate economic growth. This should include leveraging resources in public institutions that have strong balance sheets, including development finance institutions, the Unemployment Insurance Fund and metropolitan municipal councils. Page 7 of the 2016 Budget Review and pages 17-21 of the 2016 MTBPS identify key areas of intervention that are expected to stimulate growth. Some of the interventions are already being implemented and receiving funding. Key infrastructure projects, for example, will receive R947.2 billion in government funding over the medium term. Government is working with business and labour to build a foundation for faster growth. The Presidential Business Working Group and the CEO Initiative are working together to support the economy. Investments in energy, transport and telecommunications will be catalysts for growth. As the custodian of the New Growth Path, the Department of Economic Development is working with the Industrial Development Corporation to strengthen industrialisation by focusing on sectors that have significant potential for economic growth. About R60 billion has been set aside over the medium term and the highest portion of this capital will be allocated to priority value chains such as metals and mining, and agro-processing and agriculture. Linking medium-term spending proposals to government’s nine-point plan The Parliamentary Budget Office noted that the link between the medium-term spending proposals and the nine-point plan announced by government in the 2015 Budget Review are not obviously set out in the MTBPS. The committees agree with this and recommend",

The NDP and the medium-term strategic framework provide the broad framework in which budget allocations are made. Nevertheless, links with the nine-point plan, which is integrated into government policy planning, should also be clear. The National Treasury could make a specific presentation available for the consideration of the committee should this be deemed necessary. Increasing allocations to economic services departments The committees recommend that the National Treasury increase the allocation to economic affairs and will refer this to the Appropriations Committee to consider how this could be done. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation. However, due to the constrained fiscal framework, the scope for increasing allocations in any cluster, including that of economic affairs, is limited. New priorities are being funded by reprioritising funds in existing departmental baselines. Should the fiscal framework improve, increasing allocations to the economic cluster may be considered. Effectiveness of government’s job-creation initiatives such as the Jobs Fund The committees recommend that the National Treasury evaluates the effectiveness of government’s job-creation initiatives, including the Jobs Fund, in reducing the high rate of unemployment and prepare a comprehensive report for the committees by the end of the first quarter of 2017.",

    "recommendation": "106 have been contracted with a grant allocation of R5.6 billion. As a result of this grant-funding project, partners have committed an additional R7.3 billion for job creation. These partners aim to deliver 136 069 new permanent sustainable jobs, place an additional 90 087 people into vacant positions and provide 224 089 training opportunities. The fund has gathered evidence on what works when designing programmes that accelerate the transition of unemployed women and youth from education to employment, and on successful enterprise development or business incubation programmes, including in the agricultural sector. Reskilling of laid-off workers in the mining and steel industries The committees recommend that the National Treasury give concerted attention to the Financial and Fiscal Commission’s view that short- to medium-term job-creation initiatives focus on reskilling laid-off workers in the mining and steel industries through the skills levy and streamlining job-creation schemes to focus on a few selected strategic sectors. The Unemployment Insurance Fund aims to prevent job losses and create conditions conducive for job retention in companies in distress through the Turnaround Solutions Programme implemented by Productivity SA. The training layoff scheme, financed by the National Skills Fund and the Unemployment Insurance Fund, is available to vulnerable workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs due to operational requirements. It is entered into voluntarily between the employer and affected employees. The scheme involves a temporary suspension of work so that workers can be sent for training. However, take-up has been poor. As a result, the department has simplified the procedures for accessing the scheme. The government is also providing incentives and programmes to create jobs. To date, the Expanded Public Works Programme has created 4.2 million jobs of various durations and the Jobs Fund has created 132 748 jobs. The manufacturing incentive programme under the Department of Trade and Industry has created and sustained 200 000 jobs since its inception. The community work programme under the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs is also expected to create 744 369 jobs of varied duration over the medium term. Increasing labour inspectors and the impact of the Expanded Public Works Programme on decent wages The committees recommend that the National Treasury give serious attention to the Congress of South African Trade Unions’ (COSATU’s) recommendation that more labour inspectors be appointed by the Department of Labour and COSATU’s concern regarding ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 123 the unintended consequences of the Expanded Public Works Programme, which it argues has become a source of cheap labour for cash-strapped municipalities and departments. The baseline for labour inspectors is increased by R54.5 million in the 2017 MTEF period. No reductions were made to the number of labour inspector posts so that the Department of Labour could remain within the compensation ceiling. The department has faced challenges in the past in retaining inspectors and finding suitably specialised candidates because of the higher salaries offered by the private sector. The Expanded Public Works Programme complies with the wage rates determined by the Department of Labour through the Minister of Labour’s determination. The national and provincial departments of public works therefore closely monitor the implementation of the Minister of Labour’s wage determination to ensure compliance. The balance between spending restraint and tax increases Government has rightly proposed that fiscal consolidation measures be balanced between spending restraint and tax increases. Government should ensure that the progressivity of the fiscal system is a key consideration in the tax measures to be proposed in the February Budget. As in previous years, the 2017 Budget proposes both limitations of expenditure and increases in tax revenue to consolidate public finances. Tax revenue will increase by R28 billion in 2017/18 and the revenue will be raised in a progressive manner, as the largest revenue increase will arise from changes to the personal income tax system. High-income earners will face the largest increase in their tax liabilities. The progressivity of the tax amendments was carefully considered, as shown through the publication of the distributional impact of the personal income tax tables in Chapter 4 of the 2017 Budget Review. Additional revenues will be sourced through increases in dividends withholding taxes, excise duties and the fuel levy. Shifting the composition of spending towards capital spending While continuing to limit the growth of consumption spending and contain expenditure on non-essential goods and services, government should strive to increase its allocations to investment and capital spending. The National Treasury should provide further detail on the proposed financing facility for social infrastructure when the Minister of Finance tables the Budget in February. Over the medium term, the total spending on infrastructure is R947.2 billion. Overall spending on infrastructure realises nominal growth of 4 per cent over the medium term. This confirms government’s commitment to spending on public infrastructure. The proposed new budget facility for infrastructure finance is a budget reform",

Strengthening the oversight of state owned entities The committees noted elevated risks associated with state-owned companies. Government guarantees have increased substantially in recent years, and a large share of state-owned company debts are denominated in foreign currencies. In order to improve monitoring of these risks, the National Treasury should table a quarterly report in Parliament, providing updates on guarantees extended, the extent of exposure against guarantees and the data on the portfolio of state-owned company assets. The National Treasury has a review and monitoring process for managing the risks related to government guarantees issued to state-owned companies. In terms of the monitoring aspect of this process, a quarterly report outlining the movement in both the quality and volume of the guarantee portfolio is prepared and reported to the Fiscal Liabilities Committee and the Minister of Finance. This report should be able to satisfy the requirements of the committees and will be tabled in Parliament every quarter as recommended. The committees recommend that the National Treasury strengthens oversight over South African Airways (SAA) and other state-owned entities to prevent defaults, return it to profitability and reduce pressure on the national fiscus and national debt. The committees will seek to exercise more effective oversight over SAA.",

    "recommendation": "2017 BUDGET REVIEW 124 A new SAA board was appointed in September 2016. The Minister of Finance tasked the board with a number of actions and these have been receiving urgent attention. These activities included the finalisation of the annual financial statements for 2013/14 and 2014/15, both of which were concluded before the end of September 2016. SAA faces liquidity constraints in the short to medium term and government has been working closely with the board to address this, while working towards the long-term financial and commercial sustainability of the airline. With support from the National Treasury, SAA has secured funding to allow the board time to review and strengthen its turnaround plan, and take steps to stabilise the airline and return it to financial sustainability. The board is finalising the recruitment process for the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer positions so that recommendations can be submitted to the shareholder for consideration. The Minister of Finance has stressed to the SAA board that urgent action is required for the airline to operate sustainably. This includes the board reviewing and strengthening the airline's strategy to accelerate the turnaround and to ensure its robustness in the context of increasing competition and volatility in the fuel price and exchange rates. During this “business unusual” period, SAA will remain under intense government oversight through weekly, monthly and quarterly meetings. Measures to reduce lease costs The committees recommend that the National Treasury, working with the relevant departments, seeks to reduce the huge spending on leases of buildings and infrastructure. The Department of Public Works is considering ways to reduce lease costs. Application of the user-charge model, which has been developed by the Property Management Trading Entity, will enable the department to determine more accurately the cost of accommodation provided by the private sector, and use such knowledge as an instrument for negotiating more reasonable and affordable rentals. The department is also looking at providing accommodation using its own vast stock of immovable assets. Some of the buildings will need to be refurbished to bring them to the required standard for housing departments or entities, while in certain instances, like Statistics South Africa’s offices in Salvokop, new buildings will be constructed. Amendments to the Preferential Procurement Regulations The committees recommend that the National Treasury processes amendments to the Preferential Procurement Regulations speedily to ensure that previously disadvantaged groups and small, medium and micro enterprises benefit significantly. Progress on this should be provided regularly to the committees. The revised regulations were promulgated on 20 January 2017 and will be effective on 1 April 2017. The rollout of the revised regulations to practitioners, suppliers and oversight bodies such as parliamentary committees is still in the planning phase and is targeted for implementation from March 2017. Funding for post-school education The committees recommend that further allocations be considered for post-school education without prejudicing other key social programmes. The 2017 Budget provides for additional allocations to the higher education sector through internal reprioritisation and baseline reductions, so ensuring increased allocations without affecting key social programmes and compromising expenditure limits. Further allocations to post-school education will have to be considered during the 2018 Budget process by the Ministers’ Committee on the Budget. Achieving norms and standards for basic school infrastructure Equal Education is concerned that the 2016 MTBPS made no mention of basic school infrastructure and that there was insufficient funding to meet the norms and standards obligations. Equal Education suggests that the deadline of November 2016 might not be met. The committees recommend that the National Treasury respond to Equal Education’s concern about this, and its other proposals, and will refer Equal Education’s proposals to the Appropriations Committee. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 125 The November 2016 deadline was not met, but that was not due to a lack of funding. The problems in the rollout of the school infrastructure backlogs grant relate to poor performance by some implementing agents. There are difficulties in replacing underperformers with new contractors who are reluctant to “fix” previous contractors’ errors, and delays in finalising the merging and rationalisation of schools in the Eastern Cape. The National Treasury’s reply to this recommendation was sent to the Standing Committee on Appropriations through the 2016/17 second quarter expenditure report for the Department of Basic Education. Linking remuneration to performance in the public sector A critical element of containing consumption spending will be measures to limit the growth of compensation budgets. South Africa needs a stronger dialogue about performance and pay in the public sector. The DPSA, the National Treasury and the DPME should report jointly to Parliament before the middle of 2017 on the issues and concerns regarding performance, remuneration policy and pay. The National Treasury and the two departments are working on reforms for remuneration policy, performance and pay in the public service. Discussions with interested parties are taking place and a report will be tabled in Parliament. Compliance with instruction notes on cost containment The committees welcome the progress on cost containment but believe that more can be done. The committees also recommend that the National Treasury engages with the Auditor-General’s office to explore the possibility of the Auditor-General’s office conducting annual audits of the compliance of national and provincial departments, municipalities and public entities with cost- containment measures decided by the National Treasury and on reporting on these audits, which can be considered by parliamentary committees. The committees require the National Treasury to report on the possibilities of this at its first quarterly briefings of 2017. During September 2016, the National Treasury issued a revised Treasury Instruction on Cost Containment applicable to institutions that comply with the Public Finance Management Act (1999). This instruction aims to further reduce non-essential expenditure by introducing additional cost-containment measures, which include expenses on entertainment, advertising, newspapers and publications, and attendance at and the hosting of conferences. Cost-containment measures now cover more expenditure items. During April 2016, the National Treasury also issued a travel policy framework with measures to contain travel and accommodation costs. During November 2016, the National Treasury also issued a revised Circular on Cost-Containment Measures on travel and accommodation for institutions that comply with the Municipal Financial Management Act (2003). The National Treasury is drafting regulations on cost-containment measures for these municipal institutions. These regulations will contain, among others, those measures that are currently contained in the circulars. The National Treasury will engage the Auditor-General of South Africa on the possibility of including specific cost-containment expenditure items in annual audit plans. If agreement is reached on the items to be audited, the National Treasury will report annually to the committees on the outcomes of these audits. Feedback of the discussions with the Auditor-General of South Africa will be provided to the committees during the first quarterly briefings of 2017. Compensation limits, prioritisation of critical posts in the health sector and progress on the implementation of national health insurance In these difficult times, government’s commitment to sustain social spending is welcome. However, the committee notes rising pressure on social budgets, particularly in the health sector. The National Treasury and the Department of Health should review the impact of limits on compensation spending for critical services for the poor, and guidelines that help provincial and district health authorities manage more constrained budgets should be developed.",

    "recommendation": "that most of the budget cuts have been implemented in national departments and within provinces. Moderate cuts were made to the health budgets. The Minister of Finance and MECs for Finance have agreed that the health service staff should be protected while containing administrative personnel expenditure. Provinces have imposed restrictions on filling vacant posts, requiring all appointments, excluding health and education critical posts, to be approved by both the provincial treasury and the office of the premier. Only new vacant posts in health and education not budgeted for (particularly for new facilities) need the approval of the provincial treasuries and offices of the premier, because additional funding may be required. This will ensure that the provinces keep to the set ceilings without negatively affecting service delivery. The committees agree with COSATU’s concern about the impact of the moratorium placed on public service posts in the Department of Health and lack of detail in the MTBPS on progress made towards implementing national health insurance. The committees recommend that the National Treasury gives serious attention to COSATU’s concerns, and will also refer this to the Appropriations Committee. The National Treasury will manage the compensation budget and monitor it within the limited resources available. Service-delivery posts within the provincial departments of health are being protected by not filling non-critical or non-core posts, which ensures there is adequate funding. COSATU’s concerns are recognised and taken into account. It is important that service-delivery posts be funded to provide adequate services to the poor. With regards to the progress made on the implementation of national health insurance, the Department of Health is working closely with the National Treasury to address gaps in the insurance framework. Significant progress has been made in the following six work streams: • Establish the National Health Insurance Fund • Design and implement a national health insurance benefit package • Prepare for the purchaser-provider split • Explore the role of medical schemes under national health insurance • Complete policy papers for release for public comment and further analyses • Strengthen the district health system and governance. The National Treasury continues to support the implementation of national health insurance through the indirect national health insurance grant. Outreach programmes to members of the Government Employees Pension Fund The committees recommend that the National Treasury, the Government Employees Pension Fund and the Government Pensions Administrative Agency strengthen communication and public awareness campaigns to enable the members of government pension funds, including those in the rural areas, to easily access their benefits. The Government Employees Pension Fund and the Government Pensions Administrative Agency are combining communication initiatives to ensure their campaigns are more effective. The following communications and outreach programmes are in place: • National roadshows • Campaigns aimed at members who are about to retire • Quarterly newsletters for members and pensioners • Mobile offices in vans that go to rural areas to service and give information to members and pensioners • Media relations such as advisories and press releases • Exhibitions at government events such as Heritage Day celebrations • Departmental presentations on benefits and participation at union events • Client liaison officers who visit departments to assist with member queries • Workshops to equip human resources practitioners to assist members • Articles in stakeholder publications such as those of unions and departments.",

    "recommendation": "5 per cent per year over the 2017 MTEF period. Prioritising basic services in local government The National Treasury and municipalities should ensure that the funds added to the local government equitable share are used as planned. That is, to offset the cost pressures of bulk water and electricity. Section 227 of the Constitution specifies that local government is “entitled to an equitable share of revenue raised nationally to enable it to provide basic services and perform the functions allocated to it”. The local government equitable share is therefore an unconditional allocation. However, Section 153 of the Constitution states that a municipality must manage its administration and budgeting and planning processes to give priority to the basic needs of the community. Municipalities are therefore expected to prioritise the provision of free basic services in their budgets. The National Treasury and provincial treasuries will ensure that this happens through budget benchmarking processes with municipalities. Review of the local government equitable share formula The announced plans to update the local government equitable share formula with the 2016 Community Survey data should be applied in such a manner that it has minimal negative impact on certain municipalities. The release of the 2016 Community Survey provided an opportunity to update the household numbers in the formula using the most recent data. The current model for estimating household numbers has proven to be broadly consistent with the Community Survey results in most cases. However, few municipalities will experience significant changes in their allocations as a result of these updates. The Budget Forum has endorsed a three-year phase-in to minimise the impact of allocation changes to these municipalities. In 2017/18, all municipalities are guaranteed to receive at least 95 per cent of the indicative allocation for the equitable share published in the 2016 division of revenue. Improving the delivery of electrification and other basic services in metropolitan municipalities The National Treasury should ensure that coordination between the delivery of electrification and other basic services is improved in cities by incorporating the integrated national electrification programme (municipal) grant allocations for metros into the urban settlements development grant. This recommendation is supported. The National Treasury will work with the Department of Energy and the Department of Human Settlements on incorporating the integrated national electrification programme (municipal) grant allocations for metropolitan municipalities into the urban settlements development grant for 2018/19. Recommendations of the Select and Standing Committees on Finance on the 2016 Revised Fiscal Framework Managing the refinancing of maturing debt The committees note that a significant amount of long-term government debt will start to mature in 2018/19 and recommend that the National Treasury plans effectively for that and reports to committees at the 2017 MTBPS. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 121 In planning for the maturing debt over the period 2017/18 to 2020/21, the National Treasury introduced a bond- switch programme in 2014/15, exchanging shorter dated debt (bonds maturing over the period 2017/18 to 2020/21) for longer dated debt to address the high refinancing risk to the government debt portfolio. Of the R404.2 billion that was outstanding in maturing debt as at February 2015, R130.4 billion has been exchanged as at January 2017. In addition to the budgeted cash for repayment of maturing debt, the National Treasury will continue with the bond-switch auction programme to manage the refinancing of maturing debt. Strengthening the social pact to improve economic growth While recognising the difficulties, the committees recommend that the National Treasury and government as a whole intensify efforts at cooperation between government, Parliament, the private sector, trade unions and civil society to improve economic growth and create jobs. The National Treasury supports the recommendation. Building cooperation between government, Parliament, the private sector, trade unions and civil society is a critical part of inclusive economic growth. The National Treasury continues to support and engage with such efforts wherever possible. Increasing policy certainty in key sectors of the economy The committees recommend that the National Treasury and government as a whole provide policy certainty in key economic sectors and aggressively implement policies aimed at stimulating growth and restoring consumer and business confidence. Confidence is critical in raising investment, employment and economic growth. The National Treasury is working to communicate government’s efforts to increase policy certainty to local and foreign business and investor communities, international financial institutions and the South African public. The National Treasury has been spearheading coordination with business, unions and government on key initiatives such as agriculture, tourism and the YES Initiative. It continues to look for opportunities to encourage dialogue between the public and private sectors. In addition, the National Treasury debates policy with sister departments through the cluster process. Leveraging resources to stimulate economic growth The National Treasury, the Department of Economic Development and other departments should work on a programme to mobilise resources behind actions that stimulate economic growth. This should include leveraging resources in public institutions that have strong balance sheets, including development finance institutions, the Unemployment Insurance Fund and metropolitan municipal councils. Page 7 of the 2016 Budget Review and pages 17-21 of the 2016 MTBPS identify key areas of intervention that are expected to stimulate growth. Some of the interventions are already being implemented and receiving funding. Key infrastructure projects, for example, will receive R947.2 billion in government funding over the medium term. Government is working with business and labour to build a foundation for faster growth. The Presidential Business Working Group and the CEO Initiative are working together to support the economy. Investments in energy, transport and telecommunications will be catalysts for growth. As the custodian of the New Growth Path, the Department of Economic Development is working with the Industrial Development Corporation to strengthen industrialisation by focusing on sectors that have significant potential for economic growth. About R60 billion has been set aside over the medium term and the highest portion of this capital will be allocated to priority value chains such as metals and mining, and agro-processing and agriculture. Linking medium-term spending proposals to government’s nine-point plan The Parliamentary Budget Office noted that the link between the medium-term spending proposals and the nine-point plan announced by government in the 2015 Budget Review are not obviously set out in the MTBPS. The committees agree with this and recommend",

The NDP and the medium-term strategic framework provide the broad framework in which budget allocations are made. Nevertheless, links with the nine-point plan, which is integrated into government policy planning, should also be clear. The National Treasury could make a specific presentation available for the consideration of the committee should this be deemed necessary. Increasing allocations to economic services departments The committees recommend that the National Treasury increase the allocation to economic affairs and will refer this to the Appropriations Committee to consider how this could be done. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation. However, due to the constrained fiscal framework, the scope for increasing allocations in any cluster, including that of economic affairs, is limited. New priorities are being funded by reprioritising funds in existing departmental baselines. Should the fiscal framework improve, increasing allocations to the economic cluster may be considered. Effectiveness of government’s job-creation initiatives such as the Jobs Fund The committees recommend that the National Treasury evaluates the effectiveness of government’s job-creation initiatives, including the Jobs Fund, in reducing the high rate of unemployment and prepare a comprehensive report for the committees by the end of the first quarter of 2017.",

    "recommendation": "106 have been contracted with a grant allocation of R5.6 billion. As a result of this grant-funding project, partners have committed an additional R7.3 billion for job creation. These partners aim to deliver 136 069 new permanent sustainable jobs, place an additional 90 087 people into vacant positions and provide 224 089 training opportunities. The fund has gathered evidence on what works when designing programmes that accelerate the transition of unemployed women and youth from education to employment, and on successful enterprise development or business incubation programmes, including in the agricultural sector. Reskilling of laid-off workers in the mining and steel industries The committees recommend that the National Treasury give concerted attention to the Financial and Fiscal Commission’s view that short- to medium-term job-creation initiatives focus on reskilling laid-off workers in the mining and steel industries through the skills levy and streamlining job-creation schemes to focus on a few selected strategic sectors. The Unemployment Insurance Fund aims to prevent job losses and create conditions conducive for job retention in companies in distress through the Turnaround Solutions Programme implemented by Productivity SA. The training layoff scheme, financed by the National Skills Fund and the Unemployment Insurance Fund, is available to vulnerable workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs due to operational requirements. It is entered into voluntarily between the employer and affected employees. The scheme involves a temporary suspension of work so that workers can be sent for training. However, take-up has been poor. As a result, the department has simplified the procedures for accessing the scheme. The government is also providing incentives and programmes to create jobs. To date, the Expanded Public Works Programme has created 4.2 million jobs of various durations and the Jobs Fund has created 132 748 jobs. The manufacturing incentive programme under the Department of Trade and Industry has created and sustained 200 000 jobs since its inception. The community work programme under the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs is also expected to create 744 369 jobs of varied duration over the medium term. Increasing labour inspectors and the impact of the Expanded Public Works Programme on decent wages The committees recommend that the National Treasury give serious attention to the Congress of South African Trade Unions’ (COSATU’s) recommendation that more labour inspectors be appointed by the Department of Labour and COSATU’s concern regarding ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 123 the unintended consequences of the Expanded Public Works Programme, which it argues has become a source of cheap labour for cash-strapped municipalities and departments. The baseline for labour inspectors is increased by R54.5 million in the 2017 MTEF period. No reductions were made to the number of labour inspector posts so that the Department of Labour could remain within the compensation ceiling. The department has faced challenges in the past in retaining inspectors and finding suitably specialised candidates because of the higher salaries offered by the private sector. The Expanded Public Works Programme complies with the wage rates determined by the Department of Labour through the Minister of Labour’s determination. The national and provincial departments of public works therefore closely monitor the implementation of the Minister of Labour’s wage determination to ensure compliance. The balance between spending restraint and tax increases Government has rightly proposed that fiscal consolidation measures be balanced between spending restraint and tax increases. Government should ensure that the progressivity of the fiscal system is a key consideration in the tax measures to be proposed in the February Budget. As in previous years, the 2017 Budget proposes both limitations of expenditure and increases in tax revenue to consolidate public finances. Tax revenue will increase by R28 billion in 2017/18 and the revenue will be raised in a progressive manner, as the largest revenue increase will arise from changes to the personal income tax system. High-income earners will face the largest increase in their tax liabilities. The progressivity of the tax amendments was carefully considered, as shown through the publication of the distributional impact of the personal income tax tables in Chapter 4 of the 2017 Budget Review. Additional revenues will be sourced through increases in dividends withholding taxes, excise duties and the fuel levy. Shifting the composition of spending towards capital spending While continuing to limit the growth of consumption spending and contain expenditure on non-essential goods and services, government should strive to increase its allocations to investment and capital spending. The National Treasury should provide further detail on the proposed financing facility for social infrastructure when the Minister of Finance tables the Budget in February. Over the medium term, the total spending on infrastructure is R947.2 billion. Overall spending on infrastructure realises nominal growth of 4 per cent over the medium term. This confirms government’s commitment to spending on public infrastructure. The proposed new budget facility for infrastructure finance is a budget reform",

Strengthening the oversight of state owned entities The committees noted elevated risks associated with state-owned companies. Government guarantees have increased substantially in recent years, and a large share of state-owned company debts are denominated in foreign currencies. In order to improve monitoring of these risks, the National Treasury should table a quarterly report in Parliament, providing updates on guarantees extended, the extent of exposure against guarantees and the data on the portfolio of state-owned company assets. The National Treasury has a review and monitoring process for managing the risks related to government guarantees issued to state-owned companies. In terms of the monitoring aspect of this process, a quarterly report outlining the movement in both the quality and volume of the guarantee portfolio is prepared and reported to the Fiscal Liabilities Committee and the Minister of Finance. This report should be able to satisfy the requirements of the committees and will be tabled in Parliament every quarter as recommended. The committees recommend that the National Treasury strengthens oversight over South African Airways (SAA) and other state-owned entities to prevent defaults, return it to profitability and reduce pressure on the national fiscus and national debt. The committees will seek to exercise more effective oversight over SAA.",

    "recommendation": "2017 BUDGET REVIEW 124 A new SAA board was appointed in September 2016. The Minister of Finance tasked the board with a number of actions and these have been receiving urgent attention. These activities included the finalisation of the annual financial statements for 2013/14 and 2014/15, both of which were concluded before the end of September 2016. SAA faces liquidity constraints in the short to medium term and government has been working closely with the board to address this, while working towards the long-term financial and commercial sustainability of the airline. With support from the National Treasury, SAA has secured funding to allow the board time to review and strengthen its turnaround plan, and take steps to stabilise the airline and return it to financial sustainability. The board is finalising the recruitment process for the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer positions so that recommendations can be submitted to the shareholder for consideration. The Minister of Finance has stressed to the SAA board that urgent action is required for the airline to operate sustainably. This includes the board reviewing and strengthening the airline's strategy to accelerate the turnaround and to ensure its robustness in the context of increasing competition and volatility in the fuel price and exchange rates. During this “business unusual” period, SAA will remain under intense government oversight through weekly, monthly and quarterly meetings. Measures to reduce lease costs The committees recommend that the National Treasury, working with the relevant departments, seeks to reduce the huge spending on leases of buildings and infrastructure. The Department of Public Works is considering ways to reduce lease costs. Application of the user-charge model, which has been developed by the Property Management Trading Entity, will enable the department to determine more accurately the cost of accommodation provided by the private sector, and use such knowledge as an instrument for negotiating more reasonable and affordable rentals. The department is also looking at providing accommodation using its own vast stock of immovable assets. Some of the buildings will need to be refurbished to bring them to the required standard for housing departments or entities, while in certain instances, like Statistics South Africa’s offices in Salvokop, new buildings will be constructed. Amendments to the Preferential Procurement Regulations The committees recommend that the National Treasury processes amendments to the Preferential Procurement Regulations speedily to ensure that previously disadvantaged groups and small, medium and micro enterprises benefit significantly. Progress on this should be provided regularly to the committees. The revised regulations were promulgated on 20 January 2017 and will be effective on 1 April 2017. The rollout of the revised regulations to practitioners, suppliers and oversight bodies such as parliamentary committees is still in the planning phase and is targeted for implementation from March 2017. Funding for post-school education The committees recommend that further allocations be considered for post-school education without prejudicing other key social programmes. The 2017 Budget provides for additional allocations to the higher education sector through internal reprioritisation and baseline reductions, so ensuring increased allocations without affecting key social programmes and compromising expenditure limits. Further allocations to post-school education will have to be considered during the 2018 Budget process by the Ministers’ Committee on the Budget. Achieving norms and standards for basic school infrastructure Equal Education is concerned that the 2016 MTBPS made no mention of basic school infrastructure and that there was insufficient funding to meet the norms and standards obligations. Equal Education suggests that the deadline of November 2016 might not be met. The committees recommend that the National Treasury respond to Equal Education’s concern about this, and its other proposals, and will refer Equal Education’s proposals to the Appropriations Committee. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 125 The November 2016 deadline was not met, but that was not due to a lack of funding. The problems in the rollout of the school infrastructure backlogs grant relate to poor performance by some implementing agents. There are difficulties in replacing underperformers with new contractors who are reluctant to “fix” previous contractors’ errors, and delays in finalising the merging and rationalisation of schools in the Eastern Cape. The National Treasury’s reply to this recommendation was sent to the Standing Committee on Appropriations through the 2016/17 second quarter expenditure report for the Department of Basic Education. Linking remuneration to performance in the public sector A critical element of containing consumption spending will be measures to limit the growth of compensation budgets. South Africa needs a stronger dialogue about performance and pay in the public sector. The DPSA, the National Treasury and the DPME should report jointly to Parliament before the middle of 2017 on the issues and concerns regarding performance, remuneration policy and pay. The National Treasury and the two departments are working on reforms for remuneration policy, performance and pay in the public service. Discussions with interested parties are taking place and a report will be tabled in Parliament. Compliance with instruction notes on cost containment The committees welcome the progress on cost containment but believe that more can be done. The committees also recommend that the National Treasury engages with the Auditor-General’s office to explore the possibility of the Auditor-General’s office conducting annual audits of the compliance of national and provincial departments, municipalities and public entities with cost- containment measures decided by the National Treasury and on reporting on these audits, which can be considered by parliamentary committees. The committees require the National Treasury to report on the possibilities of this at its first quarterly briefings of 2017. During September 2016, the National Treasury issued a revised Treasury Instruction on Cost Containment applicable to institutions that comply with the Public Finance Management Act (1999). This instruction aims to further reduce non-essential expenditure by introducing additional cost-containment measures, which include expenses on entertainment, advertising, newspapers and publications, and attendance at and the hosting of conferences. Cost-containment measures now cover more expenditure items. During April 2016, the National Treasury also issued a travel policy framework with measures to contain travel and accommodation costs. During November 2016, the National Treasury also issued a revised Circular on Cost-Containment Measures on travel and accommodation for institutions that comply with the Municipal Financial Management Act (2003). The National Treasury is drafting regulations on cost-containment measures for these municipal institutions. These regulations will contain, among others, those measures that are currently contained in the circulars. The National Treasury will engage the Auditor-General of South Africa on the possibility of including specific cost-containment expenditure items in annual audit plans. If agreement is reached on the items to be audited, the National Treasury will report annually to the committees on the outcomes of these audits. Feedback of the discussions with the Auditor-General of South Africa will be provided to the committees during the first quarterly briefings of 2017. Compensation limits, prioritisation of critical posts in the health sector and progress on the implementation of national health insurance In these difficult times, government’s commitment to sustain social spending is welcome. However, the committee notes rising pressure on social budgets, particularly in the health sector. The National Treasury and the Department of Health should review the impact of limits on compensation spending for critical services for the poor, and guidelines that help provincial and district health authorities manage more constrained budgets should be developed.",

    "recommendation": "that most of the budget cuts have been implemented in national departments and within provinces. Moderate cuts were made to the health budgets. The Minister of Finance and MECs for Finance have agreed that the health service staff should be protected while containing administrative personnel expenditure. Provinces have imposed restrictions on filling vacant posts, requiring all appointments, excluding health and education critical posts, to be approved by both the provincial treasury and the office of the premier. Only new vacant posts in health and education not budgeted for (particularly for new facilities) need the approval of the provincial treasuries and offices of the premier, because additional funding may be required. This will ensure that the provinces keep to the set ceilings without negatively affecting service delivery. The committees agree with COSATU’s concern about the impact of the moratorium placed on public service posts in the Department of Health and lack of detail in the MTBPS on progress made towards implementing national health insurance. The committees recommend that the National Treasury gives serious attention to COSATU’s concerns, and will also refer this to the Appropriations Committee. The National Treasury will manage the compensation budget and monitor it within the limited resources available. Service-delivery posts within the provincial departments of health are being protected by not filling non-critical or non-core posts, which ensures there is adequate funding. COSATU’s concerns are recognised and taken into account. It is important that service-delivery posts be funded to provide adequate services to the poor. With regards to the progress made on the implementation of national health insurance, the Department of Health is working closely with the National Treasury to address gaps in the insurance framework. Significant progress has been made in the following six work streams: • Establish the National Health Insurance Fund • Design and implement a national health insurance benefit package • Prepare for the purchaser-provider split • Explore the role of medical schemes under national health insurance • Complete policy papers for release for public comment and further analyses • Strengthen the district health system and governance. The National Treasury continues to support the implementation of national health insurance through the indirect national health insurance grant. Outreach programmes to members of the Government Employees Pension Fund The committees recommend that the National Treasury, the Government Employees Pension Fund and the Government Pensions Administrative Agency strengthen communication and public awareness campaigns to enable the members of government pension funds, including those in the rural areas, to easily access their benefits. The Government Employees Pension Fund and the Government Pensions Administrative Agency are combining communication initiatives to ensure their campaigns are more effective. The following communications and outreach programmes are in place: • National roadshows • Campaigns aimed at members who are about to retire • Quarterly newsletters for members and pensioners • Mobile offices in vans that go to rural areas to service and give information to members and pensioners • Media relations such as advisories and press releases • Exhibitions at government events such as Heritage Day celebrations • Departmental presentations on benefits and participation at union events • Client liaison officers who visit departments to assist with member queries • Workshops to equip human resources practitioners to assist members • Articles in stakeholder publications such as those of unions and departments.",

Monitoring takes place throughout the year and independent external auditors provide annual audited progress reports on institutional expenditure. The National Treasury will work with the Department of Higher Education and Training to strengthen the existing expenditure management processes by exploring the development of cost-control instruction notes for infrastructure projects. Managing fiscal risks The National Treasury should expand the scope of the fiscal risk statement to include long-term fiscal projections that span the timeframes outlined in the National Development Plan. The fiscal risk statement should include government’s risk appetite, determine the benefits perceived from specific risk-related activities and assess the potential costs should that risk materialise, including the costs of different policy responses. This will help align resource planning with long-term fiscal sustainability. The National Treasury uses a long-term model to assess fiscal risks and spending pressures. South Africa is currently the only country outside of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to implement a long-term fiscal model. The model makes forecasts beyond the timeframe of the National Development Plan. The most recent model projections are included in the 2017 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement’s fiscal risk statement. The National Treasury’s goal in developing a fiscal risk framework is to encourage a discussion about the choices facing the country and public finance limitations in the long term. It continues to engage with local and international experts to improve the framework. Accelerating economic growth through microeconomic reforms The National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders should develop and implement a detailed programme of microeconomic reforms and other measures to boost business confidence and accelerate inclusive growth. This programme should be incorporated into dialogues with legislatures, departments and other role players and then urgently implemented. In response to weak economic growth, government has prioritised certain policies that will increase confidence, such as ensuring that fiscal policy is sustainable, stabilising state-owned companies and creating policy certainty by finalising key legislative and policy processes. Government’s microeconomic reforms are contained in the National Development Plan and expressed for implementation through the Nine-Point Plan. Implementation of these reforms is managed and monitored through the economic sectors, employment and infrastructure development cluster, which reports directly to Cabinet. Ensuring high-quality audits The National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders should develop and roll out a detailed programme ensuring that internal audit units and audit committees, as part of the governance system within departments and state-owned entities, are held to account for executing their functions competently. Internal audit units and audit committees must be prepared to recognise and report:",

    "recommendation": "2018 BUDGET REVIEW 112 Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the 2017 Adjustments Appropriation Bill Funding for state-owned companies The Minister of Finance should strengthen the conditions attached to the recapitalisation of South African Airways and the South African Post Office to minimise the risk to the state. Additional conditions could include no-bailout clauses, stricter monitoring of the companies’ contingent liabilities, publishing conditions that would negate provision of government guarantees and holding boards and executives personally liable for failure. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and the conditional grant allocations to provincial and local spheres of government Accelerating reviews of the provincial equitable share and the local government equitable share The National Treasury should accelerate the provincial equitable share and the local government equitable share review processes to compensate for conditional grant and transfer losses incurred by provinces and municipalities so that they can continue to provide much-needed services. The conditional grants are not created to compensate for shortfalls in the provincial equitable share. In line with the Constitution, the equitable share should be applied as a direct charge against the National Revenue Fund so that provinces can deliver on their mandated responsibilities. Conditional grants are created to allow local and provincial government to accelerate policy outcomes within a particular sector that align with national developmental priorities. The ongoing review of the provincial equitable share formula is a response to concerns among provinces that allocations do not change quickly enough to reflect evolving dynamics affecting needs in their areas. Extensive consultation is increasing understanding of formulaic adjustments and ensuring that the allocations preserve stability and equity. The formula is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains equitable. As part of the review, all available data sources for each component of the formula, including the health component, will be assessed. Any review outcomes would have to comply with prevailing legislation, and would then be implemented in future medium-term expenditure frameworks. The current formula for local government’s equitable share was introduced in 2013/14, after a review of the previous formula by the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and the South African Local Government Association, in partnership with the Financial and Fiscal Commission and Statistics South Africa. The formula’s principles and objectives were detailed in the Explanatory Memorandum to the 2013 Division of Revenue. The Budget Forum had endorsed a five-year phase-in to minimise the effect of allocation changes on municipalities, with 2017/18 as the final year of the phase-in. However, key data used in the formula is updated annually. The new formula links allocations to the service-delivery responsibilities of municipalities, but it remains the municipalities’ responsibility to prioritise these funds, deliver services and maintain infrastructure. Supporting municipalities to collect debt and deliver basic services The National Treasury, the South African Local Government Association and other relevant stakeholders should help municipalities to implement their debt-collection policies effectively so they can deliver basic services. The National Treasury and the South African Local Government Association must provide a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of 2018.",

    "recommendation": "• Report on matters pertaining to improvements in municipal audit outcomes and related financial management. The National Treasury agrees that there is an urgent need to address the misalignment between powers and functions for an effective fiscal system. The Department of Cooperative Governance is reviewing the functional arrangements of district municipalities. The alignment of legislation to minimise overlaps between the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act is under way, informed by the roles and responsibilities of the respective departments. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have mandated the new directors-general of their departments to finalise this process. The Municipal Regulations on Financial Misconduct Procedures and Criminal Proceedings address financial misconduct and mismanagement, including processes for reporting, investigating and disciplining misconduct. The current legal framework includes mechanisms to hold councillors and municipal officials accountable for maladministration and non- compliance. The law is seldom enforced, however, and compliance remains a problem. Ring-fencing funding for and accelerating sanitation programmes The Minister of Water and Sanitation and the Minister of Finance should ensure that the Department of Water and Sanitation and the National Treasury ring-fence funding for sanitation programmes, accelerate sanitation programmes and enhance capacity to deliver the bucket eradication programme. The National Treasury believes that water and sanitation are inextricably linked and thus the funding should not be split. Separating these functions would complicate integrated planning and implementation. The bucket eradication programme is expected to be concluded by end-March 2019. A total of R1 billion has been reprioritised within the water services infrastructure grant and the regional bulk infrastructure grant in this regard. The municipal infrastructure grant also includes conditions to prioritise funds for the reticulation aspects of the programme. Reversing the culture of non-payment across government The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should ensure that their departments and relevant stakeholders consult broadly and develop initiatives to reverse the culture of non-payment across the three spheres of government. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 115 The National Treasury agrees that this is a major concern. The Presidential Coordinating Committee is discussing the culture of non-payment across the three spheres of government, and possible measures to reverse the trend. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the 2017 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill Timely approval of rollover funds The National Treasury should effectively manage rollovers and approve them in time for the receiving provinces or municipalities to spend without compromising service delivery. The recommendation is supported. Section 21 of the 2017 Division of Revenue Act stipulates that only committed or identifiable projects would be considered for rollover funding purposes. The National Treasury instituted measures to ensure that rollover funds would be used correctly, including evidence that the project is under way and submission of a progress report on each project. Without this proof, the funding application is rejected. The provincial process begins with provincial treasuries requesting rollovers from the National Treasury on 30 April each year. After assessing the requests, the National Treasury finalises rollover amounts in consultation with provincial treasuries, based on valid commitments. Approved rollovers are then communicated to provinces within the first three months of every financial year, so provinces have the rest of the year to spend and deliver services for which rollovers have been approved. For municipalities, the application process is outlined in the Municipal Finance Management Act budget circulars. For the 2016/17 municipal financial year, the rollover funding process was concluded in the middle of October 2017, which is three months after the start of the new municipal financial year. Municipalities are expected to manage projects effectively and to reprioritise funds during the rollover funding approval period. Once the approval is granted, municipalities have almost nine months to spend their approved rollover funds. Resolving debt owed to Eskom by municipalities and provinces The committee recommends that the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, the National Treasury, the South African Local Government Association, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Eskom should prioritise resolving the debt owed to Eskom by municipalities and provinces. The stakeholders mentioned above should develop an action plan with timeframes, and report to the committee on their progress within three months of this report. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, who is the chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Task Team on constitutional matters relating to electricity reticulation, distribution and supply. The task team already has a work programme that addresses Eskom’s outstanding debt. Addressing the culture of non-payment and improving revenue collection The National Treasury and relevant stakeholders should aggressively implement initiatives to improve revenue collection and address the current culture of non-payment. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should provide strategic leadership and address governance issues in provinces and municipalities. The National Treasury agrees that all organs of state and public entities should aggressively implement initiatives to improve revenue collection. The National Treasury supports provinces in monitoring their own-revenue strategies and improving their revenue collection, including ensuring an optimal mix of service providers collecting revenue on behalf of provinces. To strengthen local government revenue management, the National Treasury and the provincial treasuries will be rolling out a project to assist municipalities with appropriate tariff-setting and effective collection systems. Through this intervention, technical advisors for revenue management will be deployed to provincial treasuries within the framework of the Municipal Finance Improvement Programme III. The advisors will support the implementation of provincial and municipal revenue management initiatives.",

The National Treasury and the national and the provincial departments of Cooperative Governance should strengthen support provided to provinces and municipalities for expenditure of conditional grants and capital and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. Together with sector departments, it provides extensive capacity- building support to the provinces and municipalities. Several programmes and conditional grants aim to strengthen capacity in local government, including the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent, the Municipal Finance Improvement Programme, the financial management grant and the municipal systems improvement grant. Several conditional infrastructure grants also include specific provision for a portion of their funds to be used to build capacity. There is a substantial allocation of resources for capacity-building in the budget. Over the next three years, government will consider increasing the efficiency of these multiple allocations by understanding and improving how they affect the actual capacity of provincial departments and municipalities. Improving spending on the municipal infrastructure grant The committee recommends that the National Treasury supports municipalities to improve spending on the municipal infrastructure grant. The National Treasury should also review the policy of withholding conditional grants and their reallocation to other municipalities. Reallocation to municipalities with perceived spending capacity does not necessarily address the core problem. Furthermore, redirecting funds away from underperforming and underspending municipalities could have unintended consequences. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. The Department of Cooperative Governance is working to strengthen the coordination structures of the municipal infrastructure grant and ensure that all relevant departments actively participate in these structures. The Department of Cooperative Governance has also reprioritised additional resources to strengthen capacity and municipalities can increase their own capacity by allocating up to 5 per cent of the grant allocation to their project management unit. The provisions for reallocating funds are not meant to be punitive. They are the final step after all efforts to assist an underperforming municipality have been exhausted.

If a local municipality underperformed, then its funds can be transferred to the district municipality to complete the local municipality’s project. Addressing misalignment in the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance have made progress in addressing misalignment between the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act. The committee urges the two parties to resolve this matter speedily. The ministers should finalise outstanding issues and table the amendment bill(s) in Parliament. The alignment of legislation to minimise overlaps between the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act is under way. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have mandated the new directors-general of their departments to finalise this process. Eliminating unfunded municipal budgets The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance should exercise effective fiscal oversight over municipal budgets. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance should provide strategic political intervention and implement consequences for unfunded budgets. The two ministers should provide the committee with a progress report on the Back to Basics project. The Department of Cooperative Governance should provide an intervention plan with timeframes for improving performance and eliminating unfunded municipal budgets. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 A funded budget is funded by cash surpluses from previous years and revenues realistically anticipated for the year. In terms of the Municipal Finance Management Act, a municipal budget must be funded before a municipal council can adopt that budget for implementation. It is a common municipal practice to overstate or inflate revenue projections when preparing an annual budget. Revenue estimates are seldom underpinned by realistic or realisable revenue assumptions, which results in cash flow difficulties. For example, the 2017/18 municipal operational deficit is R3.3 billion. If revenue underperforms projections, municipalities need to reduce expenditure. The Constitution and the Municipal Finance Management Act mandate the provinces to intervene and place a municipality under administration if there is a financial crisis. In cases where expenditure exceeds revenue or there are problems making payments, the provinces may decide whether or not to intervene. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, who will elaborate further on the Back to Basics programme. The programme developed three categories of municipal performance for action to recognise good performance and ensure appropriate consequences and support for underperformance. The programme has resulted in municipality-specific action plans, including a financial component for which treasuries are responsible. Supporting municipalities in spending and service delivery The National Treasury, provincial treasuries and the Department of Cooperative Governance should provide comprehensive support to underperforming municipalities that lack the capacity to spend their allocated budgets. This support would ensure that services are delivered as intended. The National Treasury shares the committee’s concern about additional support for underperforming municipalities. National government has a constitutional duty to support municipalities and build their capacity. Measures include capacity-building conditional grants and technical support through institutions such as the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency. There are national programmes to build capacity in financial management and help stabilise institutional and governance systems. There are a range of factors contributing to widespread financial instability in municipalities, including skills shortages, challenges in organisational structures and temporary incumbents in critical positions. The problem is compounded by ineffective councils and governance structures, and financial mismanagement. Many municipalities are politicised and poor relationships between the municipal leadership and the regional political leaders complicate governance. Government intends to introduce a conditional grant in the outer years of the 2018 MTEF period to help municipalities facing financial crises. The grant will be made available to municipalities that have demonstrated a strong commitment to undertake reforms. Filling municipal managerial vacancies The longstanding issue of filling vacant municipal manager and chief financial officer positions in municipalities should be addressed. The Department of Cooperative Governance and the National Treasury should develop short- to medium-term action plans to address this matter and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. It is available to provide a briefing on dates nominated by the committee. Filling these vacancies should be fast-tracked with competent managers. Accountability is weaker in municipalities where the position of municipal manager is vacant or occupied by an acting incumbent, as an acting manager is less inclined to make decisions. The absence of a suitably competent chief financial officer presents a risk to sound financial management. Responding to recommendations from the Financial and Fiscal Commission The National Treasury should respond to and, where applicable, implement the Financial and Fiscal Commission’s recommendations. The Constitution requires that the commission’s recommendations be considered before tabling the division of revenue. Government’s responses to the relevant recommendations are provided in part 3 of Annexure W1 of the Division of Revenue Bill (2018). The relevant national departments are considering the other recommendations and they will respond directly to the commission.",

    "recommendation": "2017 Revised Fiscal Framework Improving supervision of revenue collection The committee recommends that the South African Revenue Service and the National Treasury report in greater depth on revenue collection progress in their quarterly briefings. The National Treasury publishes monthly tax revenue collections made by the South African Revenue Service, in line with section 32 of the Public Finance Management Act. Tax revenues are reported in detail according to tax type. The National Treasury and South African Revenue Service officials will endeavour to use this information and provide more in-depth revenue analysis on the in-year performance of tax revenue collections in their quarterly briefings to the committee. Optimising government’s borrowing strategy The National Treasury should develop and implement a credible debt management strategy to monitor the “debt trap” and report to the committee quarterly. In addition to providing fiscal policy certainty, the Minister of Finance should indicate the timeframes and the levels at which debt is expected to stabilise. The minister has indicated that the debt-to-GDP ratio need not reach 60 per cent if government implements structural reforms. This must be done by government as a whole rather than by the National Treasury alone. However, the National Treasury should still report on its role in the reforms in its quarterly briefings, and the committee will hold it accountable where applicable. Preserving the expenditure ceiling Considering the R3.9 billion breach of the expenditure ceiling, the National Treasury should review spending to identify savings, including a review of departmental programmes that have failed to achieve their intended objectives over a reasonable period of time, as well as a reduction in duplicated functions in line departments and implementing agencies. The National Treasury should also enhance oversight over these agencies. Progress should be reported to the committee on a quarterly basis. Since 2013, the National Treasury has been producing performance and expenditure reviews through the Government Technical Advisory Centre. The reviews are published on the centre’s website. They follow an internationally recognised methodology for quantifying, assessing and improving the cost effectiveness of public policy, including analysis of expenditure and programme performance data. Performance and expenditure reviews help identify more effective public expenditure options and assess the cost implications of legislation. Where policy is weakly formulated or institutions are not properly aligned for programme objectives, policymakers can use the review findings to reconfigure policies, institutions and activities. In this way, the reviews improve budget planning and reporting. Satisfying the demands of credit-ratings agencies The Minister of Finance should have a plan for managing the credit-ratings agencies and keep the public and the committee informed. Upfront and timely policy statements on policy issues would assist in restoring confidence in the South African economy and trust in government. Government borrows to finance spending designated by Parliament or the Constitution. The Constitution requires that a deficit funding plan be included in the national budget. A high-level plan is included in the Budget Review as the specifics are market sensitive. The National Treasury also publishes an online annual debt management report on its website. The funding strategy reflects a balance between funding costs and debt management risks. The main choices are the proportions of domestic and international funding, the tenor of the funding instruments and the drawdown of cash balances. With the assistance of the World Bank, government has developed strategic risk benchmarks for refinancing, interest, inflation and currency risks. The benchmarks are indicators of the preferred medium-term structure of government’s debt portfolio in meeting liquidity needs subject to the cost and risk of various funding alternatives. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 119 The National Treasury has developed communication and process plans for managing engagements with the ratings agencies. The same information on sovereign rating developments is provided to the public and the finance committees. This plan is executed at policy events such as the State of the Nation Address, the Budget Review, and the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. The communications campaign uses television stations, print media, social media and online publications. The process plan includes conference calls with the ratings agencies on the days that the budgets are tabled in February and October to ensure that the agencies get timely information from policymakers. Officials from the National Treasury also hold face-to-face meetings with the ratings agencies, conduct international road shows and attend meetings of the International Monetary Forum and the Group of 20. The National Treasury has also partnered with the departments of Energy, Public Service and Administration, Public Enterprises, Economic Development, and Trade and Industry to address issues raised by the agencies. Ending corrupt practices at the state-owned companies The committee requires a progress briefing on the commitment of the Minister of Finance to improve government oversight of state-owned companies. Oversight challenges include appointing effective board members, ensuring that boards appoint competent managers, tackling wastage and corruption, and, crucially, acting against entities that are not performing. The committee urges that stringent conditions for bailouts be finalised as soon as possible. Increasing penalties for wasteful expenditure The National Treasury should increase penalties for unauthorised, irregular and wasteful expenditure, which places unnecessarily pressure on the fiscus. The National Treasury does not have authority to impose penalties for irregular expenditure. Remedial actions are the responsibility of accounting officers and authorities. The National Treasury will only condone irregular and wasteful expenditure after the accounting authorities demonstrate they have taken appropriate action.",

Supporting municipalities in spending and service delivery The National Treasury, provincial treasuries and the Department of Cooperative Governance should provide comprehensive support to underperforming municipalities that lack the capacity to spend their allocated budgets. This support would ensure that services are delivered as intended. The National Treasury shares the committee’s concern about additional support for underperforming municipalities. National government has a constitutional duty to support municipalities and build their capacity. Measures include capacity-building conditional grants and technical support through institutions such as the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency. There are national programmes to build capacity in financial management and help stabilise institutional and governance systems. There are a range of factors contributing to widespread financial instability in municipalities, including skills shortages, challenges in organisational structures and temporary incumbents in critical positions. The problem is compounded by ineffective councils and governance structures, and financial mismanagement. Many municipalities are politicised and poor relationships between the municipal leadership and the regional political leaders complicate governance. Government intends to introduce a conditional grant in the outer years of the 2018 MTEF period to help municipalities facing financial crises. The grant will be made available to municipalities that have demonstrated a strong commitment to undertake reforms. Filling municipal managerial vacancies The longstanding issue of filling vacant municipal manager and chief financial officer positions in municipalities should be addressed. The Department of Cooperative Governance and the National Treasury should develop short- to medium-term action plans to address this matter and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. It is available to provide a briefing on dates nominated by the committee. Filling these vacancies should be fast-tracked with competent managers. Accountability is weaker in municipalities where the position of municipal manager is vacant or occupied by an acting incumbent, as an acting manager is less inclined to make decisions. The absence of a suitably competent chief financial officer presents a risk to sound financial management. Responding to recommendations from the Financial and Fiscal Commission The National Treasury should respond to and, where applicable, implement the Financial and Fiscal Commission’s recommendations. The Constitution requires that the commission’s recommendations be considered before tabling the division of revenue. Government’s responses to the relevant recommendations are provided in part 3 of Annexure W1 of the Division of Revenue Bill (2018). The relevant national departments are considering the other recommendations and they will respond directly to the commission.",

    "recommendation": "2017 Revised Fiscal Framework Improving supervision of revenue collection The committee recommends that the South African Revenue Service and the National Treasury report in greater depth on revenue collection progress in their quarterly briefings. The National Treasury publishes monthly tax revenue collections made by the South African Revenue Service, in line with section 32 of the Public Finance Management Act. Tax revenues are reported in detail according to tax type. The National Treasury and South African Revenue Service officials will endeavour to use this information and provide more in-depth revenue analysis on the in-year performance of tax revenue collections in their quarterly briefings to the committee. Optimising government’s borrowing strategy The National Treasury should develop and implement a credible debt management strategy to monitor the “debt trap” and report to the committee quarterly. In addition to providing fiscal policy certainty, the Minister of Finance should indicate the timeframes and the levels at which debt is expected to stabilise. The minister has indicated that the debt-to-GDP ratio need not reach 60 per cent if government implements structural reforms. This must be done by government as a whole rather than by the National Treasury alone. However, the National Treasury should still report on its role in the reforms in its quarterly briefings, and the committee will hold it accountable where applicable. Preserving the expenditure ceiling Considering the R3.9 billion breach of the expenditure ceiling, the National Treasury should review spending to identify savings, including a review of departmental programmes that have failed to achieve their intended objectives over a reasonable period of time, as well as a reduction in duplicated functions in line departments and implementing agencies. The National Treasury should also enhance oversight over these agencies. Progress should be reported to the committee on a quarterly basis. Since 2013, the National Treasury has been producing performance and expenditure reviews through the Government Technical Advisory Centre. The reviews are published on the centre’s website. They follow an internationally recognised methodology for quantifying, assessing and improving the cost effectiveness of public policy, including analysis of expenditure and programme performance data. Performance and expenditure reviews help identify more effective public expenditure options and assess the cost implications of legislation. Where policy is weakly formulated or institutions are not properly aligned for programme objectives, policymakers can use the review findings to reconfigure policies, institutions and activities. In this way, the reviews improve budget planning and reporting. Satisfying the demands of credit-ratings agencies The Minister of Finance should have a plan for managing the credit-ratings agencies and keep the public and the committee informed. Upfront and timely policy statements on policy issues would assist in restoring confidence in the South African economy and trust in government. Government borrows to finance spending designated by Parliament or the Constitution. The Constitution requires that a deficit funding plan be included in the national budget. A high-level plan is included in the Budget Review as the specifics are market sensitive. The National Treasury also publishes an online annual debt management report on its website. The funding strategy reflects a balance between funding costs and debt management risks. The main choices are the proportions of domestic and international funding, the tenor of the funding instruments and the drawdown of cash balances. With the assistance of the World Bank, government has developed strategic risk benchmarks for refinancing, interest, inflation and currency risks. The benchmarks are indicators of the preferred medium-term structure of government’s debt portfolio in meeting liquidity needs subject to the cost and risk of various funding alternatives. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 119 The National Treasury has developed communication and process plans for managing engagements with the ratings agencies. The same information on sovereign rating developments is provided to the public and the finance committees. This plan is executed at policy events such as the State of the Nation Address, the Budget Review, and the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. The communications campaign uses television stations, print media, social media and online publications. The process plan includes conference calls with the ratings agencies on the days that the budgets are tabled in February and October to ensure that the agencies get timely information from policymakers. Officials from the National Treasury also hold face-to-face meetings with the ratings agencies, conduct international road shows and attend meetings of the International Monetary Forum and the Group of 20. The National Treasury has also partnered with the departments of Energy, Public Service and Administration, Public Enterprises, Economic Development, and Trade and Industry to address issues raised by the agencies. Ending corrupt practices at the state-owned companies The committee requires a progress briefing on the commitment of the Minister of Finance to improve government oversight of state-owned companies. Oversight challenges include appointing effective board members, ensuring that boards appoint competent managers, tackling wastage and corruption, and, crucially, acting against entities that are not performing. The committee urges that stringent conditions for bailouts be finalised as soon as possible. Increasing penalties for wasteful expenditure The National Treasury should increase penalties for unauthorised, irregular and wasteful expenditure, which places unnecessarily pressure on the fiscus. The National Treasury does not have authority to impose penalties for irregular expenditure. Remedial actions are the responsibility of accounting officers and authorities. The National Treasury will only condone irregular and wasteful expenditure after the accounting authorities demonstrate they have taken appropriate action.",

    "recommendation": "2018 BUDGET REVIEW 110 Infrastructure grants to higher education institutions are subject to rigorous performance and financial monitoring and oversight by the Department of Higher Education and Training to ensure that these grants are used efficiently and for the intended purpose. Monitoring takes place throughout the year and independent external auditors provide annual audited progress reports on institutional expenditure. The National Treasury will work with the Department of Higher Education and Training to strengthen the existing expenditure management processes by exploring the development of cost-control instruction notes for infrastructure projects. Managing fiscal risks The National Treasury should expand the scope of the fiscal risk statement to include long-term fiscal projections that span the timeframes outlined in the National Development Plan. The fiscal risk statement should include government’s risk appetite, determine the benefits perceived from specific risk-related activities and assess the potential costs should that risk materialise, including the costs of different policy responses. This will help align resource planning with long-term fiscal sustainability. The National Treasury uses a long-term model to assess fiscal risks and spending pressures. South Africa is currently the only country outside of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to implement a long-term fiscal model. The model makes forecasts beyond the timeframe of the National Development Plan. The most recent model projections are included in the 2017 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement’s fiscal risk statement. The National Treasury’s goal in developing a fiscal risk framework is to encourage a discussion about the choices facing the country and public finance limitations in the long term. It continues to engage with local and international experts to improve the framework. Accelerating economic growth through microeconomic reforms The National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders should develop and implement a detailed programme of microeconomic reforms and other measures to boost business confidence and accelerate inclusive growth. This programme should be incorporated into dialogues with legislatures, departments and other role players and then urgently implemented. In response to weak economic growth, government has prioritised certain policies that will increase confidence, such as ensuring that fiscal policy is sustainable, stabilising state-owned companies and creating policy certainty by finalising key legislative and policy processes. Government’s microeconomic reforms are contained in the National Development Plan and expressed for implementation through the Nine-Point Plan. Implementation of these reforms is managed and monitored through the economic sectors, employment and infrastructure development cluster, which reports directly to Cabinet. Ensuring high-quality audits The National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders should develop and roll out a detailed programme ensuring that internal audit units and audit committees, as part of the governance system within departments and state-owned entities, are held to account for executing their functions competently. Internal audit units and audit committees must be prepared to recognise and report:",

    "recommendation": "2018 BUDGET REVIEW 112 Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the 2017 Adjustments Appropriation Bill Funding for state-owned companies The Minister of Finance should strengthen the conditions attached to the recapitalisation of South African Airways and the South African Post Office to minimise the risk to the state. Additional conditions could include no-bailout clauses, stricter monitoring of the companies’ contingent liabilities, publishing conditions that would negate provision of government guarantees and holding boards and executives personally liable for failure. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and the conditional grant allocations to provincial and local spheres of government Accelerating reviews of the provincial equitable share and the local government equitable share The National Treasury should accelerate the provincial equitable share and the local government equitable share review processes to compensate for conditional grant and transfer losses incurred by provinces and municipalities so that they can continue to provide much-needed services. The conditional grants are not created to compensate for shortfalls in the provincial equitable share. In line with the Constitution, the equitable share should be applied as a direct charge against the National Revenue Fund so that provinces can deliver on their mandated responsibilities. Conditional grants are created to allow local and provincial government to accelerate policy outcomes within a particular sector that align with national developmental priorities. The ongoing review of the provincial equitable share formula is a response to concerns among provinces that allocations do not change quickly enough to reflect evolving dynamics affecting needs in their areas. Extensive consultation is increasing understanding of formulaic adjustments and ensuring that the allocations preserve stability and equity. The formula is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains equitable. As part of the review, all available data sources for each component of the formula, including the health component, will be assessed. Any review outcomes would have to comply with prevailing legislation, and would then be implemented in future medium-term expenditure frameworks. The current formula for local government’s equitable share was introduced in 2013/14, after a review of the previous formula by the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and the South African Local Government Association, in partnership with the Financial and Fiscal Commission and Statistics South Africa. The formula’s principles and objectives were detailed in the Explanatory Memorandum to the 2013 Division of Revenue. The Budget Forum had endorsed a five-year phase-in to minimise the effect of allocation changes on municipalities, with 2017/18 as the final year of the phase-in. However, key data used in the formula is updated annually. The new formula links allocations to the service-delivery responsibilities of municipalities, but it remains the municipalities’ responsibility to prioritise these funds, deliver services and maintain infrastructure. Supporting municipalities to collect debt and deliver basic services The National Treasury, the South African Local Government Association and other relevant stakeholders should help municipalities to implement their debt-collection policies effectively so they can deliver basic services. The National Treasury and the South African Local Government Association must provide a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of 2018.",

The National Treasury agrees that there is an urgent need to address the misalignment between powers and functions for an effective fiscal system. The Department of Cooperative Governance is reviewing the functional arrangements of district municipalities. The alignment of legislation to minimise overlaps between the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act is under way, informed by the roles and responsibilities of the respective departments. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have mandated the new directors-general of their departments to finalise this process. The Municipal Regulations on Financial Misconduct Procedures and Criminal Proceedings address financial misconduct and mismanagement, including processes for reporting, investigating and disciplining misconduct. The current legal framework includes mechanisms to hold councillors and municipal officials accountable for maladministration and non- compliance. The law is seldom enforced, however, and compliance remains a problem. Ring-fencing funding for and accelerating sanitation programmes The Minister of Water and Sanitation and the Minister of Finance should ensure that the Department of Water and Sanitation and the National Treasury ring-fence funding for sanitation programmes, accelerate sanitation programmes and enhance capacity to deliver the bucket eradication programme. The National Treasury believes that water and sanitation are inextricably linked and thus the funding should not be split. Separating these functions would complicate integrated planning and implementation. The bucket eradication programme is expected to be concluded by end-March 2019. A total of R1 billion has been reprioritised within the water services infrastructure grant and the regional bulk infrastructure grant in this regard. The municipal infrastructure grant also includes conditions to prioritise funds for the reticulation aspects of the programme. Reversing the culture of non-payment across government The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should ensure that their departments and relevant stakeholders consult broadly and develop initiatives to reverse the culture of non-payment across the three spheres of government. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 115 The National Treasury agrees that this is a major concern. The Presidential Coordinating Committee is discussing the culture of non-payment across the three spheres of government, and possible measures to reverse the trend. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the 2017 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill Timely approval of rollover funds The National Treasury should effectively manage rollovers and approve them in time for the receiving provinces or municipalities to spend without compromising service delivery. The recommendation is supported. Section 21 of the 2017 Division of Revenue Act stipulates that only committed or identifiable projects would be considered for rollover funding purposes. The National Treasury instituted measures to ensure that rollover funds would be used correctly, including evidence that the project is under way and submission of a progress report on each project. Without this proof, the funding application is rejected. The provincial process begins with provincial treasuries requesting rollovers from the National Treasury on 30 April each year. After assessing the requests, the National Treasury finalises rollover amounts in consultation with provincial treasuries, based on valid commitments. Approved rollovers are then communicated to provinces within the first three months of every financial year, so provinces have the rest of the year to spend and deliver services for which rollovers have been approved. For municipalities, the application process is outlined in the Municipal Finance Management Act budget circulars. For the 2016/17 municipal financial year, the rollover funding process was concluded in the middle of October 2017, which is three months after the start of the new municipal financial year. Municipalities are expected to manage projects effectively and to reprioritise funds during the rollover funding approval period. Once the approval is granted, municipalities have almost nine months to spend their approved rollover funds. Resolving debt owed to Eskom by municipalities and provinces The committee recommends that the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, the National Treasury, the South African Local Government Association, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Eskom should prioritise resolving the debt owed to Eskom by municipalities and provinces. The stakeholders mentioned above should develop an action plan with timeframes, and report to the committee on their progress within three months of this report. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, who is the chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Task Team on constitutional matters relating to electricity reticulation, distribution and supply. The task team already has a work programme that addresses Eskom’s outstanding debt. Addressing the culture of non-payment and improving revenue collection The National Treasury and relevant stakeholders should aggressively implement initiatives to improve revenue collection and address the current culture of non-payment. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should provide strategic leadership and address governance issues in provinces and municipalities. The National Treasury agrees that all organs of state and public entities should aggressively implement initiatives to improve revenue collection. The National Treasury supports provinces in monitoring their own-revenue strategies and improving their revenue collection, including ensuring an optimal mix of service providers collecting revenue on behalf of provinces. To strengthen local government revenue management, the National Treasury and the provincial treasuries will be rolling out a project to assist municipalities with appropriate tariff-setting and effective collection systems. Through this intervention, technical advisors for revenue management will be deployed to provincial treasuries within the framework of the Municipal Finance Improvement Programme III. The advisors will support the implementation of provincial and municipal revenue management initiatives.",

    "recommendation": "2018 BUDGET REVIEW 116 Strengthening delivery of timely, high-quality services The state needs to enhance the timely delivery of quality services. The National Treasury and the national and the provincial departments of Cooperative Governance should strengthen support provided to provinces and municipalities for expenditure of conditional grants and capital and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. Together with sector departments, it provides extensive capacity- building support to the provinces and municipalities. Several programmes and conditional grants aim to strengthen capacity in local government, including the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent, the Municipal Finance Improvement Programme, the financial management grant and the municipal systems improvement grant. Several conditional infrastructure grants also include specific provision for a portion of their funds to be used to build capacity. There is a substantial allocation of resources for capacity-building in the budget. Over the next three years, government will consider increasing the efficiency of these multiple allocations by understanding and improving how they affect the actual capacity of provincial departments and municipalities. Improving spending on the municipal infrastructure grant The committee recommends that the National Treasury supports municipalities to improve spending on the municipal infrastructure grant. The National Treasury should also review the policy of withholding conditional grants and their reallocation to other municipalities. Reallocation to municipalities with perceived spending capacity does not necessarily address the core problem. Furthermore, redirecting funds away from underperforming and underspending municipalities could have unintended consequences. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. The Department of Cooperative Governance is working to strengthen the coordination structures of the municipal infrastructure grant and ensure that all relevant departments actively participate in these structures. The Department of Cooperative Governance has also reprioritised additional resources to strengthen capacity and municipalities can increase their own capacity by allocating up to 5 per cent of the grant allocation to their project management unit. The provisions for reallocating funds are not meant to be punitive. They are the final step after all efforts to assist an underperforming municipality have been exhausted. The reallocation of funds facilitates service provision by ensuring",

    "recommendation": "that municipalities with registered projects that are ready for implementation are prioritised. If a local municipality underperformed, then its funds can be transferred to the district municipality to complete the local municipality’s project. Addressing misalignment in the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance have made progress in addressing misalignment between the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act. The committee urges the two parties to resolve this matter speedily. The ministers should finalise outstanding issues and table the amendment bill(s) in Parliament. The alignment of legislation to minimise overlaps between the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act is under way. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have mandated the new directors-general of their departments to finalise this process. Eliminating unfunded municipal budgets The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance should exercise effective fiscal oversight over municipal budgets. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance should provide strategic political intervention and implement consequences for unfunded budgets. The two ministers should provide the committee with a progress report on the Back to Basics project. The Department of Cooperative Governance should provide an intervention plan with timeframes for improving performance and eliminating unfunded municipal budgets. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 A funded budget is funded by cash surpluses from previous years and revenues realistically anticipated for the year. In terms of the Municipal Finance Management Act, a municipal budget must be funded before a municipal council can adopt that budget for implementation. It is a common municipal practice to overstate or inflate revenue projections when preparing an annual budget. Revenue estimates are seldom underpinned by realistic or realisable revenue assumptions, which results in cash flow difficulties. For example, the 2017/18 municipal operational deficit is R3.3 billion. If revenue underperforms projections, municipalities need to reduce expenditure. The Constitution and the Municipal Finance Management Act mandate the provinces to intervene and place a municipality under administration if there is a financial crisis. In cases where expenditure exceeds revenue or there are problems making payments, the provinces may decide whether or not to intervene. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, who will elaborate further on the Back to Basics programme. The programme developed three categories of municipal performance for action to recognise good performance and ensure appropriate consequences and support for underperformance. The programme has resulted in municipality-specific action plans, including a financial component for which treasuries are responsible. Supporting municipalities in spending and service delivery The National Treasury, provincial treasuries and the Department of Cooperative Governance should provide comprehensive support to underperforming municipalities that lack the capacity to spend their allocated budgets. This support would ensure that services are delivered as intended. The National Treasury shares the committee’s concern about additional support for underperforming municipalities. National government has a constitutional duty to support municipalities and build their capacity. Measures include capacity-building conditional grants and technical support through institutions such as the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency. There are national programmes to build capacity in financial management and help stabilise institutional and governance systems. There are a range of factors contributing to widespread financial instability in municipalities, including skills shortages, challenges in organisational structures and temporary incumbents in critical positions. The problem is compounded by ineffective councils and governance structures, and financial mismanagement. Many municipalities are politicised and poor relationships between the municipal leadership and the regional political leaders complicate governance. Government intends to introduce a conditional grant in the outer years of the 2018 MTEF period to help municipalities facing financial crises. The grant will be made available to municipalities that have demonstrated a strong commitment to undertake reforms. Filling municipal managerial vacancies The longstanding issue of filling vacant municipal manager and chief financial officer positions in municipalities should be addressed. The Department of Cooperative Governance and the National Treasury should develop short- to medium-term action plans to address this matter and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. It is available to provide a briefing on dates nominated by the committee. Filling these vacancies should be fast-tracked with competent managers. Accountability is weaker in municipalities where the position of municipal manager is vacant or occupied by an acting incumbent, as an acting manager is less inclined to make decisions. The absence of a suitably competent chief financial officer presents a risk to sound financial management. Responding to recommendations from the Financial and Fiscal Commission The National Treasury should respond to and, where applicable, implement the Financial and Fiscal Commission’s recommendations. The Constitution requires that the commission’s recommendations be considered before tabling the division of revenue. Government’s responses to the relevant recommendations are provided in part 3 of Annexure W1 of the Division of Revenue Bill (2018). The relevant national departments are considering the other recommendations and they will respond directly to the commission.",

    "recommendation": "2017 Revised Fiscal Framework Improving supervision of revenue collection The committee recommends that the South African Revenue Service and the National Treasury report in greater depth on revenue collection progress in their quarterly briefings. The National Treasury publishes monthly tax revenue collections made by the South African Revenue Service, in line with section 32 of the Public Finance Management Act. Tax revenues are reported in detail according to tax type. The National Treasury and South African Revenue Service officials will endeavour to use this information and provide more in-depth revenue analysis on the in-year performance of tax revenue collections in their quarterly briefings to the committee. Optimising government’s borrowing strategy The National Treasury should develop and implement a credible debt management strategy to monitor the “debt trap” and report to the committee quarterly. In addition to providing fiscal policy certainty, the Minister of Finance should indicate the timeframes and the levels at which debt is expected to stabilise. The minister has indicated that the debt-to-GDP ratio need not reach 60 per cent if government implements structural reforms. This must be done by government as a whole rather than by the National Treasury alone. However, the National Treasury should still report on its role in the reforms in its quarterly briefings, and the committee will hold it accountable where applicable. Preserving the expenditure ceiling Considering the R3.9 billion breach of the expenditure ceiling, the National Treasury should review spending to identify savings, including a review of departmental programmes that have failed to achieve their intended objectives over a reasonable period of time, as well as a reduction in duplicated functions in line departments and implementing agencies. The National Treasury should also enhance oversight over these agencies. Progress should be reported to the committee on a quarterly basis. Since 2013, the National Treasury has been producing performance and expenditure reviews through the Government Technical Advisory Centre. The reviews are published on the centre’s website. They follow an internationally recognised methodology for quantifying, assessing and improving the cost effectiveness of public policy, including analysis of expenditure and programme performance data. Performance and expenditure reviews help identify more effective public expenditure options and assess the cost implications of legislation. Where policy is weakly formulated or institutions are not properly aligned for programme objectives, policymakers can use the review findings to reconfigure policies, institutions and activities. In this way, the reviews improve budget planning and reporting. Satisfying the demands of credit-ratings agencies The Minister of Finance should have a plan for managing the credit-ratings agencies and keep the public and the committee informed. Upfront and timely policy statements on policy issues would assist in restoring confidence in the South African economy and trust in government. Government borrows to finance spending designated by Parliament or the Constitution. The Constitution requires that a deficit funding plan be included in the national budget. A high-level plan is included in the Budget Review as the specifics are market sensitive. The National Treasury also publishes an online annual debt management report on its website. The funding strategy reflects a balance between funding costs and debt management risks. The main choices are the proportions of domestic and international funding, the tenor of the funding instruments and the drawdown of cash balances. With the assistance of the World Bank, government has developed strategic risk benchmarks for refinancing, interest, inflation and currency risks. The benchmarks are indicators of the preferred medium-term structure of government’s debt portfolio in meeting liquidity needs subject to the cost and risk of various funding alternatives. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 119 The National Treasury has developed communication and process plans for managing engagements with the ratings agencies. The same information on sovereign rating developments is provided to the public and the finance committees. This plan is executed at policy events such as the State of the Nation Address, the Budget Review, and the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. The communications campaign uses television stations, print media, social media and online publications. The process plan includes conference calls with the ratings agencies on the days that the budgets are tabled in February and October to ensure that the agencies get timely information from policymakers. Officials from the National Treasury also hold face-to-face meetings with the ratings agencies, conduct international road shows and attend meetings of the International Monetary Forum and the Group of 20. The National Treasury has also partnered with the departments of Energy, Public Service and Administration, Public Enterprises, Economic Development, and Trade and Industry to address issues raised by the agencies. Ending corrupt practices at the state-owned companies The committee requires a progress briefing on the commitment of the Minister of Finance to improve government oversight of state-owned companies. Oversight challenges include appointing effective board members, ensuring that boards appoint competent managers, tackling wastage and corruption, and, crucially, acting against entities that are not performing. The committee urges that stringent conditions for bailouts be finalised as soon as possible. Increasing penalties for wasteful expenditure The National Treasury should increase penalties for unauthorised, irregular and wasteful expenditure, which places unnecessarily pressure on the fiscus. The National Treasury does not have authority to impose penalties for irregular expenditure. Remedial actions are the responsibility of accounting officers and authorities. The National Treasury will only condone irregular and wasteful expenditure after the accounting authorities demonstrate they have taken appropriate action.",

Monitoring takes place throughout the year and independent external auditors provide annual audited progress reports on institutional expenditure. The National Treasury will work with the Department of Higher Education and Training to strengthen the existing expenditure management processes by exploring the development of cost-control instruction notes for infrastructure projects. Managing fiscal risks The National Treasury should expand the scope of the fiscal risk statement to include long-term fiscal projections that span the timeframes outlined in the National Development Plan. The fiscal risk statement should include government’s risk appetite, determine the benefits perceived from specific risk-related activities and assess the potential costs should that risk materialise, including the costs of different policy responses. This will help align resource planning with long-term fiscal sustainability. The National Treasury uses a long-term model to assess fiscal risks and spending pressures. South Africa is currently the only country outside of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to implement a long-term fiscal model. The model makes forecasts beyond the timeframe of the National Development Plan. The most recent model projections are included in the 2017 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement’s fiscal risk statement. The National Treasury’s goal in developing a fiscal risk framework is to encourage a discussion about the choices facing the country and public finance limitations in the long term. It continues to engage with local and international experts to improve the framework. Accelerating economic growth through microeconomic reforms The National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders should develop and implement a detailed programme of microeconomic reforms and other measures to boost business confidence and accelerate inclusive growth. This programme should be incorporated into dialogues with legislatures, departments and other role players and then urgently implemented. In response to weak economic growth, government has prioritised certain policies that will increase confidence, such as ensuring that fiscal policy is sustainable, stabilising state-owned companies and creating policy certainty by finalising key legislative and policy processes. Government’s microeconomic reforms are contained in the National Development Plan and expressed for implementation through the Nine-Point Plan. Implementation of these reforms is managed and monitored through the economic sectors, employment and infrastructure development cluster, which reports directly to Cabinet. Ensuring high-quality audits The National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders should develop and roll out a detailed programme ensuring that internal audit units and audit committees, as part of the governance system within departments and state-owned entities, are held to account for executing their functions competently.

Additional conditions could include no-bailout clauses, stricter monitoring of the companies’ contingent liabilities, publishing conditions that would negate provision of government guarantees and holding boards and executives personally liable for failure. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and the conditional grant allocations to provincial and local spheres of government Accelerating reviews of the provincial equitable share and the local government equitable share The National Treasury should accelerate the provincial equitable share and the local government equitable share review processes to compensate for conditional grant and transfer losses incurred by provinces and municipalities so that they can continue to provide much-needed services. The conditional grants are not created to compensate for shortfalls in the provincial equitable share. In line with the Constitution, the equitable share should be applied as a direct charge against the National Revenue Fund so that provinces can deliver on their mandated responsibilities. Conditional grants are created to allow local and provincial government to accelerate policy outcomes within a particular sector that align with national developmental priorities. The ongoing review of the provincial equitable share formula is a response to concerns among provinces that allocations do not change quickly enough to reflect evolving dynamics affecting needs in their areas. Extensive consultation is increasing understanding of formulaic adjustments and ensuring that the allocations preserve stability and equity. The formula is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains equitable. As part of the review, all available data sources for each component of the formula, including the health component, will be assessed. Any review outcomes would have to comply with prevailing legislation, and would then be implemented in future medium-term expenditure frameworks. The current formula for local government’s equitable share was introduced in 2013/14, after a review of the previous formula by the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and the South African Local Government Association, in partnership with the Financial and Fiscal Commission and Statistics South Africa. The formula’s principles and objectives were detailed in the Explanatory Memorandum to the 2013 Division of Revenue. The Budget Forum had endorsed a five-year phase-in to minimise the effect of allocation changes on municipalities, with 2017/18 as the final year of the phase-in. However, key data used in the formula is updated annually. The new formula links allocations to the service-delivery responsibilities of municipalities, but it remains the municipalities’ responsibility to prioritise these funds, deliver services and maintain infrastructure. Supporting municipalities to collect debt and deliver basic services The National Treasury, the South African Local Government Association and other relevant stakeholders should help municipalities to implement their debt-collection policies effectively so they can deliver basic services. The National Treasury and the South African Local Government Association must provide a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of 2018.",

The National Treasury agrees that there is an urgent need to address the misalignment between powers and functions for an effective fiscal system. The Department of Cooperative Governance is reviewing the functional arrangements of district municipalities. The alignment of legislation to minimise overlaps between the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act is under way, informed by the roles and responsibilities of the respective departments. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have mandated the new directors-general of their departments to finalise this process. The Municipal Regulations on Financial Misconduct Procedures and Criminal Proceedings address financial misconduct and mismanagement, including processes for reporting, investigating and disciplining misconduct. The current legal framework includes mechanisms to hold councillors and municipal officials accountable for maladministration and non- compliance. The law is seldom enforced, however, and compliance remains a problem. Ring-fencing funding for and accelerating sanitation programmes The Minister of Water and Sanitation and the Minister of Finance should ensure that the Department of Water and Sanitation and the National Treasury ring-fence funding for sanitation programmes, accelerate sanitation programmes and enhance capacity to deliver the bucket eradication programme. The National Treasury believes that water and sanitation are inextricably linked and thus the funding should not be split. Separating these functions would complicate integrated planning and implementation. The bucket eradication programme is expected to be concluded by end-March 2019. A total of R1 billion has been reprioritised within the water services infrastructure grant and the regional bulk infrastructure grant in this regard. The municipal infrastructure grant also includes conditions to prioritise funds for the reticulation aspects of the programme. Reversing the culture of non-payment across government The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should ensure that their departments and relevant stakeholders consult broadly and develop initiatives to reverse the culture of non-payment across the three spheres of government. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 115 The National Treasury agrees that this is a major concern. The Presidential Coordinating Committee is discussing the culture of non-payment across the three spheres of government, and possible measures to reverse the trend. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the 2017 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill Timely approval of rollover funds The National Treasury should effectively manage rollovers and approve them in time for the receiving provinces or municipalities to spend without compromising service delivery. The recommendation is supported. Section 21 of the 2017 Division of Revenue Act stipulates that only committed or identifiable projects would be considered for rollover funding purposes. The National Treasury instituted measures to ensure that rollover funds would be used correctly, including evidence that the project is under way and submission of a progress report on each project. Without this proof, the funding application is rejected. The provincial process begins with provincial treasuries requesting rollovers from the National Treasury on 30 April each year. After assessing the requests, the National Treasury finalises rollover amounts in consultation with provincial treasuries, based on valid commitments. Approved rollovers are then communicated to provinces within the first three months of every financial year, so provinces have the rest of the year to spend and deliver services for which rollovers have been approved. For municipalities, the application process is outlined in the Municipal Finance Management Act budget circulars. For the 2016/17 municipal financial year, the rollover funding process was concluded in the middle of October 2017, which is three months after the start of the new municipal financial year. Municipalities are expected to manage projects effectively and to reprioritise funds during the rollover funding approval period. Once the approval is granted, municipalities have almost nine months to spend their approved rollover funds. Resolving debt owed to Eskom by municipalities and provinces The committee recommends that the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, the National Treasury, the South African Local Government Association, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Eskom should prioritise resolving the debt owed to Eskom by municipalities and provinces. The stakeholders mentioned above should develop an action plan with timeframes, and report to the committee on their progress within three months of this report. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, who is the chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Task Team on constitutional matters relating to electricity reticulation, distribution and supply. The task team already has a work programme that addresses Eskom’s outstanding debt. Addressing the culture of non-payment and improving revenue collection The National Treasury and relevant stakeholders should aggressively implement initiatives to improve revenue collection and address the current culture of non-payment. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should provide strategic leadership and address governance issues in provinces and municipalities. The National Treasury agrees that all organs of state and public entities should aggressively implement initiatives to improve revenue collection. The National Treasury supports provinces in monitoring their own-revenue strategies and improving their revenue collection, including ensuring an optimal mix of service providers collecting revenue on behalf of provinces. To strengthen local government revenue management, the National Treasury and the provincial treasuries will be rolling out a project to assist municipalities with appropriate tariff-setting and effective collection systems. Through this intervention, technical advisors for revenue management will be deployed to provincial treasuries within the framework of the Municipal Finance Improvement Programme III. The advisors will support the implementation of provincial and municipal revenue management initiatives.",

The National Treasury and the national and the provincial departments of Cooperative Governance should strengthen support provided to provinces and municipalities for expenditure of conditional grants and capital and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. Together with sector departments, it provides extensive capacity- building support to the provinces and municipalities. Several programmes and conditional grants aim to strengthen capacity in local government, including the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent, the Municipal Finance Improvement Programme, the financial management grant and the municipal systems improvement grant. Several conditional infrastructure grants also include specific provision for a portion of their funds to be used to build capacity. There is a substantial allocation of resources for capacity-building in the budget. Over the next three years, government will consider increasing the efficiency of these multiple allocations by understanding and improving how they affect the actual capacity of provincial departments and municipalities. Improving spending on the municipal infrastructure grant The committee recommends that the National Treasury supports municipalities to improve spending on the municipal infrastructure grant. The National Treasury should also review the policy of withholding conditional grants and their reallocation to other municipalities. Reallocation to municipalities with perceived spending capacity does not necessarily address the core problem. Furthermore, redirecting funds away from underperforming and underspending municipalities could have unintended consequences. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. The Department of Cooperative Governance is working to strengthen the coordination structures of the municipal infrastructure grant and ensure that all relevant departments actively participate in these structures. The Department of Cooperative Governance has also reprioritised additional resources to strengthen capacity and municipalities can increase their own capacity by allocating up to 5 per cent of the grant allocation to their project management unit. The provisions for reallocating funds are not meant to be punitive. They are the final step after all efforts to assist an underperforming municipality have been exhausted.

    "recommendation": "that municipalities with registered projects that are ready for implementation are prioritised. If a local municipality underperformed, then its funds can be transferred to the district municipality to complete the local municipality’s project. Addressing misalignment in the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance have made progress in addressing misalignment between the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act. The committee urges the two parties to resolve this matter speedily. The ministers should finalise outstanding issues and table the amendment bill(s) in Parliament. The alignment of legislation to minimise overlaps between the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act is under way. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have mandated the new directors-general of their departments to finalise this process. Eliminating unfunded municipal budgets The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance should exercise effective fiscal oversight over municipal budgets. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance should provide strategic political intervention and implement consequences for unfunded budgets. The two ministers should provide the committee with a progress report on the Back to Basics project. The Department of Cooperative Governance should provide an intervention plan with timeframes for improving performance and eliminating unfunded municipal budgets. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 A funded budget is funded by cash surpluses from previous years and revenues realistically anticipated for the year. In terms of the Municipal Finance Management Act, a municipal budget must be funded before a municipal council can adopt that budget for implementation. It is a common municipal practice to overstate or inflate revenue projections when preparing an annual budget. Revenue estimates are seldom underpinned by realistic or realisable revenue assumptions, which results in cash flow difficulties. For example, the 2017/18 municipal operational deficit is R3.3 billion. If revenue underperforms projections, municipalities need to reduce expenditure. The Constitution and the Municipal Finance Management Act mandate the provinces to intervene and place a municipality under administration if there is a financial crisis. In cases where expenditure exceeds revenue or there are problems making payments, the provinces may decide whether or not to intervene. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, who will elaborate further on the Back to Basics programme. The programme developed three categories of municipal performance for action to recognise good performance and ensure appropriate consequences and support for underperformance. The programme has resulted in municipality-specific action plans, including a financial component for which treasuries are responsible. Supporting municipalities in spending and service delivery The National Treasury, provincial treasuries and the Department of Cooperative Governance should provide comprehensive support to underperforming municipalities that lack the capacity to spend their allocated budgets. This support would ensure that services are delivered as intended. The National Treasury shares the committee’s concern about additional support for underperforming municipalities. National government has a constitutional duty to support municipalities and build their capacity. Measures include capacity-building conditional grants and technical support through institutions such as the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency. There are national programmes to build capacity in financial management and help stabilise institutional and governance systems. There are a range of factors contributing to widespread financial instability in municipalities, including skills shortages, challenges in organisational structures and temporary incumbents in critical positions. The problem is compounded by ineffective councils and governance structures, and financial mismanagement. Many municipalities are politicised and poor relationships between the municipal leadership and the regional political leaders complicate governance. Government intends to introduce a conditional grant in the outer years of the 2018 MTEF period to help municipalities facing financial crises. The grant will be made available to municipalities that have demonstrated a strong commitment to undertake reforms. Filling municipal managerial vacancies The longstanding issue of filling vacant municipal manager and chief financial officer positions in municipalities should be addressed. The Department of Cooperative Governance and the National Treasury should develop short- to medium-term action plans to address this matter and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. It is available to provide a briefing on dates nominated by the committee. Filling these vacancies should be fast-tracked with competent managers. Accountability is weaker in municipalities where the position of municipal manager is vacant or occupied by an acting incumbent, as an acting manager is less inclined to make decisions. The absence of a suitably competent chief financial officer presents a risk to sound financial management. Responding to recommendations from the Financial and Fiscal Commission The National Treasury should respond to and, where applicable, implement the Financial and Fiscal Commission’s recommendations. The Constitution requires that the commission’s recommendations be considered before tabling the division of revenue. Government’s responses to the relevant recommendations are provided in part 3 of Annexure W1 of the Division of Revenue Bill (2018). The relevant national departments are considering the other recommendations and they will respond directly to the commission.",

    "recommendation": "2017 Revised Fiscal Framework Improving supervision of revenue collection The committee recommends that the South African Revenue Service and the National Treasury report in greater depth on revenue collection progress in their quarterly briefings. The National Treasury publishes monthly tax revenue collections made by the South African Revenue Service, in line with section 32 of the Public Finance Management Act. Tax revenues are reported in detail according to tax type. The National Treasury and South African Revenue Service officials will endeavour to use this information and provide more in-depth revenue analysis on the in-year performance of tax revenue collections in their quarterly briefings to the committee. Optimising government’s borrowing strategy The National Treasury should develop and implement a credible debt management strategy to monitor the “debt trap” and report to the committee quarterly. In addition to providing fiscal policy certainty, the Minister of Finance should indicate the timeframes and the levels at which debt is expected to stabilise. The minister has indicated that the debt-to-GDP ratio need not reach 60 per cent if government implements structural reforms. This must be done by government as a whole rather than by the National Treasury alone. However, the National Treasury should still report on its role in the reforms in its quarterly briefings, and the committee will hold it accountable where applicable. Preserving the expenditure ceiling Considering the R3.9 billion breach of the expenditure ceiling, the National Treasury should review spending to identify savings, including a review of departmental programmes that have failed to achieve their intended objectives over a reasonable period of time, as well as a reduction in duplicated functions in line departments and implementing agencies. The National Treasury should also enhance oversight over these agencies. Progress should be reported to the committee on a quarterly basis. Since 2013, the National Treasury has been producing performance and expenditure reviews through the Government Technical Advisory Centre. The reviews are published on the centre’s website. They follow an internationally recognised methodology for quantifying, assessing and improving the cost effectiveness of public policy, including analysis of expenditure and programme performance data. Performance and expenditure reviews help identify more effective public expenditure options and assess the cost implications of legislation. Where policy is weakly formulated or institutions are not properly aligned for programme objectives, policymakers can use the review findings to reconfigure policies, institutions and activities. In this way, the reviews improve budget planning and reporting. Satisfying the demands of credit-ratings agencies The Minister of Finance should have a plan for managing the credit-ratings agencies and keep the public and the committee informed. Upfront and timely policy statements on policy issues would assist in restoring confidence in the South African economy and trust in government. Government borrows to finance spending designated by Parliament or the Constitution. The Constitution requires that a deficit funding plan be included in the national budget. A high-level plan is included in the Budget Review as the specifics are market sensitive. The National Treasury also publishes an online annual debt management report on its website. The funding strategy reflects a balance between funding costs and debt management risks. The main choices are the proportions of domestic and international funding, the tenor of the funding instruments and the drawdown of cash balances. With the assistance of the World Bank, government has developed strategic risk benchmarks for refinancing, interest, inflation and currency risks. The benchmarks are indicators of the preferred medium-term structure of government’s debt portfolio in meeting liquidity needs subject to the cost and risk of various funding alternatives. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 119 The National Treasury has developed communication and process plans for managing engagements with the ratings agencies. The same information on sovereign rating developments is provided to the public and the finance committees. This plan is executed at policy events such as the State of the Nation Address, the Budget Review, and the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. The communications campaign uses television stations, print media, social media and online publications. The process plan includes conference calls with the ratings agencies on the days that the budgets are tabled in February and October to ensure that the agencies get timely information from policymakers. Officials from the National Treasury also hold face-to-face meetings with the ratings agencies, conduct international road shows and attend meetings of the International Monetary Forum and the Group of 20. The National Treasury has also partnered with the departments of Energy, Public Service and Administration, Public Enterprises, Economic Development, and Trade and Industry to address issues raised by the agencies. Ending corrupt practices at the state-owned companies The committee requires a progress briefing on the commitment of the Minister of Finance to improve government oversight of state-owned companies. Oversight challenges include appointing effective board members, ensuring that boards appoint competent managers, tackling wastage and corruption, and, crucially, acting against entities that are not performing. The committee urges that stringent conditions for bailouts be finalised as soon as possible. Increasing penalties for wasteful expenditure The National Treasury should increase penalties for unauthorised, irregular and wasteful expenditure, which places unnecessarily pressure on the fiscus. The National Treasury does not have authority to impose penalties for irregular expenditure. Remedial actions are the responsibility of accounting officers and authorities. The National Treasury will only condone irregular and wasteful expenditure after the accounting authorities demonstrate they have taken appropriate action.",

    "recommendation": "2018 BUDGET REVIEW 116 Strengthening delivery of timely, high-quality services The state needs to enhance the timely delivery of quality services. The National Treasury and the national and the provincial departments of Cooperative Governance should strengthen support provided to provinces and municipalities for expenditure of conditional grants and capital and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. Together with sector departments, it provides extensive capacity- building support to the provinces and municipalities. Several programmes and conditional grants aim to strengthen capacity in local government, including the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent, the Municipal Finance Improvement Programme, the financial management grant and the municipal systems improvement grant. Several conditional infrastructure grants also include specific provision for a portion of their funds to be used to build capacity. There is a substantial allocation of resources for capacity-building in the budget. Over the next three years, government will consider increasing the efficiency of these multiple allocations by understanding and improving how they affect the actual capacity of provincial departments and municipalities. Improving spending on the municipal infrastructure grant The committee recommends that the National Treasury supports municipalities to improve spending on the municipal infrastructure grant. The National Treasury should also review the policy of withholding conditional grants and their reallocation to other municipalities. Reallocation to municipalities with perceived spending capacity does not necessarily address the core problem. Furthermore, redirecting funds away from underperforming and underspending municipalities could have unintended consequences. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. The Department of Cooperative Governance is working to strengthen the coordination structures of the municipal infrastructure grant and ensure that all relevant departments actively participate in these structures. The Department of Cooperative Governance has also reprioritised additional resources to strengthen capacity and municipalities can increase their own capacity by allocating up to 5 per cent of the grant allocation to their project management unit. The provisions for reallocating funds are not meant to be punitive. They are the final step after all efforts to assist an underperforming municipality have been exhausted. The reallocation of funds facilitates service provision by ensuring",

    "recommendation": "that municipalities with registered projects that are ready for implementation are prioritised. If a local municipality underperformed, then its funds can be transferred to the district municipality to complete the local municipality’s project. Addressing misalignment in the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance have made progress in addressing misalignment between the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act. The committee urges the two parties to resolve this matter speedily. The ministers should finalise outstanding issues and table the amendment bill(s) in Parliament. The alignment of legislation to minimise overlaps between the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act is under way. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have mandated the new directors-general of their departments to finalise this process. Eliminating unfunded municipal budgets The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance should exercise effective fiscal oversight over municipal budgets. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance should provide strategic political intervention and implement consequences for unfunded budgets. The two ministers should provide the committee with a progress report on the Back to Basics project. The Department of Cooperative Governance should provide an intervention plan with timeframes for improving performance and eliminating unfunded municipal budgets. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 A funded budget is funded by cash surpluses from previous years and revenues realistically anticipated for the year. In terms of the Municipal Finance Management Act, a municipal budget must be funded before a municipal council can adopt that budget for implementation. It is a common municipal practice to overstate or inflate revenue projections when preparing an annual budget. Revenue estimates are seldom underpinned by realistic or realisable revenue assumptions, which results in cash flow difficulties. For example, the 2017/18 municipal operational deficit is R3.3 billion. If revenue underperforms projections, municipalities need to reduce expenditure. The Constitution and the Municipal Finance Management Act mandate the provinces to intervene and place a municipality under administration if there is a financial crisis. In cases where expenditure exceeds revenue or there are problems making payments, the provinces may decide whether or not to intervene. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, who will elaborate further on the Back to Basics programme. The programme developed three categories of municipal performance for action to recognise good performance and ensure appropriate consequences and support for underperformance. The programme has resulted in municipality-specific action plans, including a financial component for which treasuries are responsible. Supporting municipalities in spending and service delivery The National Treasury, provincial treasuries and the Department of Cooperative Governance should provide comprehensive support to underperforming municipalities that lack the capacity to spend their allocated budgets.

Monitoring takes place throughout the year and independent external auditors provide annual audited progress reports on institutional expenditure. The National Treasury will work with the Department of Higher Education and Training to strengthen the existing expenditure management processes by exploring the development of cost-control instruction notes for infrastructure projects. Managing fiscal risks The National Treasury should expand the scope of the fiscal risk statement to include long-term fiscal projections that span the timeframes outlined in the National Development Plan. The fiscal risk statement should include government’s risk appetite, determine the benefits perceived from specific risk-related activities and assess the potential costs should that risk materialise, including the costs of different policy responses. This will help align resource planning with long-term fiscal sustainability. The National Treasury uses a long-term model to assess fiscal risks and spending pressures. South Africa is currently the only country outside of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to implement a long-term fiscal model. The model makes forecasts beyond the timeframe of the National Development Plan. The most recent model projections are included in the 2017 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement’s fiscal risk statement. The National Treasury’s goal in developing a fiscal risk framework is to encourage a discussion about the choices facing the country and public finance limitations in the long term. It continues to engage with local and international experts to improve the framework. Accelerating economic growth through microeconomic reforms The National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders should develop and implement a detailed programme of microeconomic reforms and other measures to boost business confidence and accelerate inclusive growth. This programme should be incorporated into dialogues with legislatures, departments and other role players and then urgently implemented. In response to weak economic growth, government has prioritised certain policies that will increase confidence, such as ensuring that fiscal policy is sustainable, stabilising state-owned companies and creating policy certainty by finalising key legislative and policy processes. Government’s microeconomic reforms are contained in the National Development Plan and expressed for implementation through the Nine-Point Plan. Implementation of these reforms is managed and monitored through the economic sectors, employment and infrastructure development cluster, which reports directly to Cabinet. Ensuring high-quality audits The National Treasury and all relevant stakeholders should develop and roll out a detailed programme ensuring that internal audit units and audit committees, as part of the governance system within departments and state-owned entities, are held to account for executing their functions competently.

Additional conditions could include no-bailout clauses, stricter monitoring of the companies’ contingent liabilities, publishing conditions that would negate provision of government guarantees and holding boards and executives personally liable for failure. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and the conditional grant allocations to provincial and local spheres of government Accelerating reviews of the provincial equitable share and the local government equitable share The National Treasury should accelerate the provincial equitable share and the local government equitable share review processes to compensate for conditional grant and transfer losses incurred by provinces and municipalities so that they can continue to provide much-needed services. The conditional grants are not created to compensate for shortfalls in the provincial equitable share. In line with the Constitution, the equitable share should be applied as a direct charge against the National Revenue Fund so that provinces can deliver on their mandated responsibilities. Conditional grants are created to allow local and provincial government to accelerate policy outcomes within a particular sector that align with national developmental priorities. The ongoing review of the provincial equitable share formula is a response to concerns among provinces that allocations do not change quickly enough to reflect evolving dynamics affecting needs in their areas. Extensive consultation is increasing understanding of formulaic adjustments and ensuring that the allocations preserve stability and equity. The formula is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains equitable. As part of the review, all available data sources for each component of the formula, including the health component, will be assessed. Any review outcomes would have to comply with prevailing legislation, and would then be implemented in future medium-term expenditure frameworks. The current formula for local government’s equitable share was introduced in 2013/14, after a review of the previous formula by the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and the South African Local Government Association, in partnership with the Financial and Fiscal Commission and Statistics South Africa. The formula’s principles and objectives were detailed in the Explanatory Memorandum to the 2013 Division of Revenue. The Budget Forum had endorsed a five-year phase-in to minimise the effect of allocation changes on municipalities, with 2017/18 as the final year of the phase-in. However, key data used in the formula is updated annually. The new formula links allocations to the service-delivery responsibilities of municipalities, but it remains the municipalities’ responsibility to prioritise these funds, deliver services and maintain infrastructure. Supporting municipalities to collect debt and deliver basic services The National Treasury, the South African Local Government Association and other relevant stakeholders should help municipalities to implement their debt-collection policies effectively so they can deliver basic services. The National Treasury and the South African Local Government Association must provide a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of 2018.",

The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have mandated the new directors-general of their departments to finalise this process. The Municipal Regulations on Financial Misconduct Procedures and Criminal Proceedings address financial misconduct and mismanagement, including processes for reporting, investigating and disciplining misconduct. The current legal framework includes mechanisms to hold councillors and municipal officials accountable for maladministration and non- compliance. The law is seldom enforced, however, and compliance remains a problem. Ring-fencing funding for and accelerating sanitation programmes The Minister of Water and Sanitation and the Minister of Finance should ensure that the Department of Water and Sanitation and the National Treasury ring-fence funding for sanitation programmes, accelerate sanitation programmes and enhance capacity to deliver the bucket eradication programme. The National Treasury believes that water and sanitation are inextricably linked and thus the funding should not be split. Separating these functions would complicate integrated planning and implementation. The bucket eradication programme is expected to be concluded by end-March 2019. A total of R1 billion has been reprioritised within the water services infrastructure grant and the regional bulk infrastructure grant in this regard. The municipal infrastructure grant also includes conditions to prioritise funds for the reticulation aspects of the programme. Reversing the culture of non-payment across government The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should ensure that their departments and relevant stakeholders consult broadly and develop initiatives to reverse the culture of non-payment across the three spheres of government. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 115 The National Treasury agrees that this is a major concern. The Presidential Coordinating Committee is discussing the culture of non-payment across the three spheres of government, and possible measures to reverse the trend. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the 2017 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill Timely approval of rollover funds The National Treasury should effectively manage rollovers and approve them in time for the receiving provinces or municipalities to spend without compromising service delivery. The recommendation is supported. Section 21 of the 2017 Division of Revenue Act stipulates that only committed or identifiable projects would be considered for rollover funding purposes. The National Treasury instituted measures to ensure that rollover funds would be used correctly, including evidence that the project is under way and submission of a progress report on each project. Without this proof, the funding application is rejected. The provincial process begins with provincial treasuries requesting rollovers from the National Treasury on 30 April each year. After assessing the requests, the National Treasury finalises rollover amounts in consultation with provincial treasuries, based on valid commitments. Approved rollovers are then communicated to provinces within the first three months of every financial year, so provinces have the rest of the year to spend and deliver services for which rollovers have been approved. For municipalities, the application process is outlined in the Municipal Finance Management Act budget circulars. For the 2016/17 municipal financial year, the rollover funding process was concluded in the middle of October 2017, which is three months after the start of the new municipal financial year. Municipalities are expected to manage projects effectively and to reprioritise funds during the rollover funding approval period. Once the approval is granted, municipalities have almost nine months to spend their approved rollover funds. Resolving debt owed to Eskom by municipalities and provinces The committee recommends that the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, the National Treasury, the South African Local Government Association, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Eskom should prioritise resolving the debt owed to Eskom by municipalities and provinces. The stakeholders mentioned above should develop an action plan with timeframes, and report to the committee on their progress within three months of this report. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, who is the chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Task Team on constitutional matters relating to electricity reticulation, distribution and supply. The task team already has a work programme that addresses Eskom’s outstanding debt. Addressing the culture of non-payment and improving revenue collection The National Treasury and relevant stakeholders should aggressively implement initiatives to improve revenue collection and address the current culture of non-payment. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should provide strategic leadership and address governance issues in provinces and municipalities. The National Treasury agrees that all organs of state and public entities should aggressively implement initiatives to improve revenue collection. The National Treasury supports provinces in monitoring their own-revenue strategies and improving their revenue collection, including ensuring an optimal mix of service providers collecting revenue on behalf of provinces. To strengthen local government revenue management, the National Treasury and the provincial treasuries will be rolling out a project to assist municipalities with appropriate tariff-setting and effective collection systems. Through this intervention, technical advisors for revenue management will be deployed to provincial treasuries within the framework of the Municipal Finance Improvement Programme III. The advisors will support the implementation of provincial and municipal revenue management initiatives.",

    "recommendation": "2018 BUDGET REVIEW 116 Strengthening delivery of timely, high-quality services The state needs to enhance the timely delivery of quality services. The National Treasury and the national and the provincial departments of Cooperative Governance should strengthen support provided to provinces and municipalities for expenditure of conditional grants and capital and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. Together with sector departments, it provides extensive capacity- building support to the provinces and municipalities. Several programmes and conditional grants aim to strengthen capacity in local government, including the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent, the Municipal Finance Improvement Programme, the financial management grant and the municipal systems improvement grant. Several conditional infrastructure grants also include specific provision for a portion of their funds to be used to build capacity. There is a substantial allocation of resources for capacity-building in the budget. Over the next three years, government will consider increasing the efficiency of these multiple allocations by understanding and improving how they affect the actual capacity of provincial departments and municipalities. Improving spending on the municipal infrastructure grant The committee recommends that the National Treasury supports municipalities to improve spending on the municipal infrastructure grant. The National Treasury should also review the policy of withholding conditional grants and their reallocation to other municipalities. Reallocation to municipalities with perceived spending capacity does not necessarily address the core problem. Furthermore, redirecting funds away from underperforming and underspending municipalities could have unintended consequences. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. The Department of Cooperative Governance is working to strengthen the coordination structures of the municipal infrastructure grant and ensure that all relevant departments actively participate in these structures. The Department of Cooperative Governance has also reprioritised additional resources to strengthen capacity and municipalities can increase their own capacity by allocating up to 5 per cent of the grant allocation to their project management unit. The provisions for reallocating funds are not meant to be punitive. They are the final step after all efforts to assist an underperforming municipality have been exhausted. The reallocation of funds facilitates service provision by ensuring",

    "recommendation": "that municipalities with registered projects that are ready for implementation are prioritised. If a local municipality underperformed, then its funds can be transferred to the district municipality to complete the local municipality’s project. Addressing misalignment in the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance have made progress in addressing misalignment between the Municipal Systems Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act. The committee urges the two parties to resolve this matter speedily. The ministers should finalise outstanding issues and table the amendment bill(s) in Parliament. The alignment of legislation to minimise overlaps between the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act is under way. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have mandated the new directors-general of their departments to finalise this process. Eliminating unfunded municipal budgets The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance should exercise effective fiscal oversight over municipal budgets. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance should provide strategic political intervention and implement consequences for unfunded budgets. The two ministers should provide the committee with a progress report on the Back to Basics project. The Department of Cooperative Governance should provide an intervention plan with timeframes for improving performance and eliminating unfunded municipal budgets. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 A funded budget is funded by cash surpluses from previous years and revenues realistically anticipated for the year. In terms of the Municipal Finance Management Act, a municipal budget must be funded before a municipal council can adopt that budget for implementation. It is a common municipal practice to overstate or inflate revenue projections when preparing an annual budget. Revenue estimates are seldom underpinned by realistic or realisable revenue assumptions, which results in cash flow difficulties. For example, the 2017/18 municipal operational deficit is R3.3 billion. If revenue underperforms projections, municipalities need to reduce expenditure. The Constitution and the Municipal Finance Management Act mandate the provinces to intervene and place a municipality under administration if there is a financial crisis. In cases where expenditure exceeds revenue or there are problems making payments, the provinces may decide whether or not to intervene. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, who will elaborate further on the Back to Basics programme. The programme developed three categories of municipal performance for action to recognise good performance and ensure appropriate consequences and support for underperformance. The programme has resulted in municipality-specific action plans, including a financial component for which treasuries are responsible. Supporting municipalities in spending and service delivery The National Treasury, provincial treasuries and the Department of Cooperative Governance should provide comprehensive support to underperforming municipalities that lack the capacity to spend their allocated budgets. This support would ensure that services are delivered as intended. The National Treasury shares the committee’s concern about additional support for underperforming municipalities. National government has a constitutional duty to support municipalities and build their capacity. Measures include capacity-building conditional grants and technical support through institutions such as the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency. There are national programmes to build capacity in financial management and help stabilise institutional and governance systems. There are a range of factors contributing to widespread financial instability in municipalities, including skills shortages, challenges in organisational structures and temporary incumbents in critical positions. The problem is compounded by ineffective councils and governance structures, and financial mismanagement. Many municipalities are politicised and poor relationships between the municipal leadership and the regional political leaders complicate governance. Government intends to introduce a conditional grant in the outer years of the 2018 MTEF period to help municipalities facing financial crises. The grant will be made available to municipalities that have demonstrated a strong commitment to undertake reforms. Filling municipal managerial vacancies The longstanding issue of filling vacant municipal manager and chief financial officer positions in municipalities should be addressed. The Department of Cooperative Governance and the National Treasury should develop short- to medium-term action plans to address this matter and report their progress to the committee. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. It is available to provide a briefing on dates nominated by the committee. Filling these vacancies should be fast-tracked with competent managers. Accountability is weaker in municipalities where the position of municipal manager is vacant or occupied by an acting incumbent, as an acting manager is less inclined to make decisions. The absence of a suitably competent chief financial officer presents a risk to sound financial management. Responding to recommendations from the Financial and Fiscal Commission The National Treasury should respond to and, where applicable, implement the Financial and Fiscal Commission’s recommendations. The Constitution requires that the commission’s recommendations be considered before tabling the division of revenue. Government’s responses to the relevant recommendations are provided in part 3 of Annexure W1 of the Division of Revenue Bill (2018). The relevant national departments are considering the other recommendations and they will respond directly to the commission.",

    "recommendation": "2017 Revised Fiscal Framework Improving supervision of revenue collection The committee recommends that the South African Revenue Service and the National Treasury report in greater depth on revenue collection progress in their quarterly briefings. The National Treasury publishes monthly tax revenue collections made by the South African Revenue Service, in line with section 32 of the Public Finance Management Act. Tax revenues are reported in detail according to tax type. The National Treasury and South African Revenue Service officials will endeavour to use this information and provide more in-depth revenue analysis on the in-year performance of tax revenue collections in their quarterly briefings to the committee. Optimising government’s borrowing strategy The National Treasury should develop and implement a credible debt management strategy to monitor the “debt trap” and report to the committee quarterly. In addition to providing fiscal policy certainty, the Minister of Finance should indicate the timeframes and the levels at which debt is expected to stabilise. The minister has indicated that the debt-to-GDP ratio need not reach 60 per cent if government implements structural reforms. This must be done by government as a whole rather than by the National Treasury alone. However, the National Treasury should still report on its role in the reforms in its quarterly briefings, and the committee will hold it accountable where applicable. Preserving the expenditure ceiling Considering the R3.9 billion breach of the expenditure ceiling, the National Treasury should review spending to identify savings, including a review of departmental programmes that have failed to achieve their intended objectives over a reasonable period of time, as well as a reduction in duplicated functions in line departments and implementing agencies. The National Treasury should also enhance oversight over these agencies. Progress should be reported to the committee on a quarterly basis. Since 2013, the National Treasury has been producing performance and expenditure reviews through the Government Technical Advisory Centre. The reviews are published on the centre’s website. They follow an internationally recognised methodology for quantifying, assessing and improving the cost effectiveness of public policy, including analysis of expenditure and programme performance data. Performance and expenditure reviews help identify more effective public expenditure options and assess the cost implications of legislation. Where policy is weakly formulated or institutions are not properly aligned for programme objectives, policymakers can use the review findings to reconfigure policies, institutions and activities. In this way, the reviews improve budget planning and reporting. Satisfying the demands of credit-ratings agencies The Minister of Finance should have a plan for managing the credit-ratings agencies and keep the public and the committee informed. Upfront and timely policy statements on policy issues would assist in restoring confidence in the South African economy and trust in government. Government borrows to finance spending designated by Parliament or the Constitution. The Constitution requires that a deficit funding plan be included in the national budget. A high-level plan is included in the Budget Review as the specifics are market sensitive. The National Treasury also publishes an online annual debt management report on its website. The funding strategy reflects a balance between funding costs and debt management risks. The main choices are the proportions of domestic and international funding, the tenor of the funding instruments and the drawdown of cash balances. With the assistance of the World Bank, government has developed strategic risk benchmarks for refinancing, interest, inflation and currency risks. The benchmarks are indicators of the preferred medium-term structure of government’s debt portfolio in meeting liquidity needs subject to the cost and risk of various funding alternatives. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 119 The National Treasury has developed communication and process plans for managing engagements with the ratings agencies. The same information on sovereign rating developments is provided to the public and the finance committees. This plan is executed at policy events such as the State of the Nation Address, the Budget Review, and the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. The communications campaign uses television stations, print media, social media and online publications. The process plan includes conference calls with the ratings agencies on the days that the budgets are tabled in February and October to ensure that the agencies get timely information from policymakers. Officials from the National Treasury also hold face-to-face meetings with the ratings agencies, conduct international road shows and attend meetings of the International Monetary Forum and the Group of 20. The National Treasury has also partnered with the departments of Energy, Public Service and Administration, Public Enterprises, Economic Development, and Trade and Industry to address issues raised by the agencies. Ending corrupt practices at the state-owned companies The committee requires a progress briefing on the commitment of the Minister of Finance to improve government oversight of state-owned companies. Oversight challenges include appointing effective board members, ensuring that boards appoint competent managers, tackling wastage and corruption, and, crucially, acting against entities that are not performing. The committee urges that stringent conditions for bailouts be finalised as soon as possible. Increasing penalties for wasteful expenditure The National Treasury should increase penalties for unauthorised, irregular and wasteful expenditure, which places unnecessarily pressure on the fiscus. The National Treasury does not have authority to impose penalties for irregular expenditure. Remedial actions are the responsibility of accounting officers and authorities. The National Treasury will only condone irregular and wasteful expenditure after the accounting authorities demonstrate they have taken appropriate action.",

The Prudential Authority (PA) is a regulatory body established under the Financial Sector Regulation Act, 2017, operating within the administration of the South African Reserve Bank. Its mandate is to promote and maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions that provide financial products and services, and to protect financial customers against systemic risks. The PA’s work is guided by the Twin Peaks model, functioning alongside the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) as part of the broader financial sector regulatory framework. 4.66. During the 2024/25 financial year, the PA achieved 92 percent of its key performance indicators (12 of 13 targets), maintaining strong regulatory oversight across the banking, insurance, and financial conglomerate sectors. The Authority received an unqualified audit opinion with no material findings, marking the fifth consecutive clean audit. 4.67. The Authority’s total revenue for 2024/25 amounted to R1.96 billion, up from R1.84 billion in 2023/24, representing a 6.5 percent year-on-year increase mainly due to higher levies collected from regulated entities and interest income. Total expenditure amounted to R1.93 billion, yielding a surplus of R31.8 million, compared to a deficit of R22.4 million in 2023/24. The improved financial performance was attributed to savings on professional fees and enhanced cost containment on administrative expenses. 4.68. The PA’s regulatory coverage included 33 registered banks, 45 insurers, 6 reinsurers, 11 cooperative banks, 16 conglomerate groups, and 28 financial market infrastructures.

The Ombud emphasised that the sharp rise in complaints reflected improved public trust in dispute resolution mechanisms and greater awareness of consumer rights, rather than an increase in industry misconduct. The Office continued to support the Ombud Council in harmonising standards and improving coordination among financial ombud schemes. 4.104. The FAIS Ombud’s priorities for the forthcoming year include enhancing digital complaint management systems, strengthening cooperation with the Ombud Council and industry bodies, and expanding access for consumers in underserved regions through online and mobile complaint submission platforms. OFFICE OF THE PENSION FUNDS ADJUDICATOR OVERVIEW (2024/25) 4.105. The Office of the Pension Funds Adjudicator (OPFA) is a statutory ombud scheme established in terms of the Pension Funds Act, 1956 (Act No. 24 of 1956), with the mandate to resolve pension fund–related complaints in a fair, economical, and expeditious manner as provided under section 30D of the Act. The OPFA provides free and accessible dispute-resolution services, issuing determinations that carry the same enforceability as High Court orders. Its jurisdiction excludes the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF), Transnet Pension Fund, Post Office Pension Fund, and Associated Institutions Pension Fund (AIPF). 4.106. For the 2024/25 financial year, the OPFA recorded significant improvements in operational efficiency and service delivery. The Office received 10,331 new complaints, compared with 9,177 in 2023/24, representing a 12.6 percent increase year-on-year. The increase was attributed to greater public awareness and the anticipated surge in queries related to the Two-Pot Retirement System, which came into effect in September 2024. Of these, 10,100 complaints were finalised, reflecting a 97.8 percent case finalisation rate, up from 96 percent in the previous financial year. 4.107. The Office achieved 100 percent of its 14 key performance indicators, including the 93 percent of complaints finalised within six months, exceeding its target of 85 percent. The average resolution time continued to improve due to enhanced case management systems and an effective triage process between the New Complaints Unit (NCU), Early Resolution Unit (ER), and Case Management Teams 1 to 3. 4.108. The Auditor-General issued a clean audit opinion for the tenth consecutive year, confirming that the OPFA maintained sound financial controls, accurate reporting, and full compliance with the PFMA. The Office also achieved 100 percent compliance with the legislative requirement to pay suppliers within 30 days, reinforcing its financial discipline and operational integrity. 4.109. The OPFA’s case statistics revealed persistent patterns in the nature of complaints. The majority related to section 13A non-compliance, which covers employer failures to register employees, pay contributions on time, or contribute at the prescribed rate. Such non-compliance affects fund credits, withdrawal, retirement, disability, and death benefits. Other common complaints involved withdrawal benefits, death benefits, retirement annuities, and benefit statements. 4.110. The Top 10 funds most frequently cited for section 13A and withdrawal-benefit complaints included the Private Security Sector Provident Fund, Contract Cleaning National Provident Fund, Transport 17",

The IRBA achieved 13 of 14 performance indicators (93 percent). The only unmet target was under Operational Effectiveness, related to the delayed implementation of an enterprise resource-planning (ERP) module. All other divisions, Standards, Education and Transformation, Inspections, Investigations, and Disciplinary, achieved 100 percent of their key performance indicators. 4.126. Looking forward, the 2026–2030 Strategic Plan prioritises strengthening the audit-profession pipeline, accelerating digital transformation, enhancing collaboration with the National Treasury and Parliament, and advocating for regulatory reforms to align with evolving international auditing standards. The IRBA also aims to improve audit-quality outcomes beyond the current 45 percent benchmark and continue restoring public confidence in the auditing profession. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW (2024/25) 4.127. The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) is established in terms of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999). Its statutory mandate is to determine generally recognised accounting practice (GRAP) for all spheres of government, ensure consistency in public sector financial reporting, and promote transparency, accountability, and effective management of public resources. 4.128. For the 2024/25 financial year, the ASB achieved 10 out of 14 annual performance targets, equivalent to a 71 percent achievement rate, compared to 86 percent in the previous year. The unachieved targets were primarily linked to capacity shortages, delays in stakeholder consultation, and the re-exposure of certain accounting pronouncements. Despite these challenges, the Board maintained its unbroken record of clean audits since inception, with the Auditor-General confirming an unqualified opinion with no findings and no instances of unauthorised, irregular, fruitless, or wasteful expenditure. 4.129. The ASB’s approved budget for the 2024/25 year was R14.83 million, funded primarily through a transfer from National Treasury. Actual revenue amounted to R15.29 million, comprising R14.64 19",

    "recommendation": "51 percent of cost-recovery projects were paid by year-end, and 70 percent of client payments were received after 90 days or more, resulting in a shortfall of R54 million. This necessitated the use of interest income and internal reserves to maintain liquidity and meet payment obligations. The entity also absorbed delays in client payments to ensure suppliers were paid within statutory deadlines, which further strained its operational budget. 4.145. Employee compensation costs accounted for R75 million, and GTAC confirmed that it continued to subsidise late client payments to maintain operational continuity. The management proposed that clients consider prepayment mechanisms to improve cash flow management and mitigate future funding shortfalls. 4.146. GTAC sustained its record of clean audits and high performance across its service portfolio. It remained a key technical partner to government in public finance reform, infrastructure advisory, and institutional strengthening. The Centre’s multi-disciplinary expertise and collaborative approach positioned it as an essential enabler of the state’s capability agenda. 4.147. Looking forward, GTAC’s focus areas include expanding partnerships for infrastructure delivery, improving cost-recovery systems, enhancing its digital Knowledge Hub, and strengthening technical advisory capabilities. The Centre also aims to scale up its contribution to the National Infrastructure Plan (NIP 2050) and continue driving innovation in project management and expenditure reviews to improve value for money across government. DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SOUTHERN AFRICA OVERVIEW (2024/25) 4.148. The Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) operates under the DBSA Act, 1997 (Act No. 13 of 1997), with the statutory mandate to promote economic development and growth, build human and institutional capacity, and support sustainable development projects and programmes in South Africa and across the African continent. The Bank is wholly owned by the South African Government and plays a key role in financing and implementing infrastructure and development projects aligned with national priorities. 4.149. The DBSA’s total infrastructure development support reached R91.3 billion for the year ended 31 March 2025, compared to R72.9 billion in 2023/24, representing a 25.2 percent increase. This amount included R17.5 billion in disbursements, exceeding the annual target of R14.5 billion by 18 21",

    "recommendation": "3.2 percent, down from 3.9 percent in 2023/24, reflecting improved asset quality and risk management. 4.152. Financial sustainability indicators remained robust. The Bank’s debt-to-equity ratio improved to 78 percent (2024: 89 percent), while the net interest margin (NIM) increased to 7.3 percent (2024: 7.2 percent). The capital-to-unweighted assets ratio stood at 48 percent, compared to 44 percent in the prior year, well above the regulatory minimum stipulated under the DBSA Act. Liquidity also strengthened, with total holdings rising to R15.02 billion, up from R10.8 billion in March 2024. 4.153. On governance and compliance, the DBSA maintained its unqualified audit opinion for the 2024/25 financial year, continuing its record of unbroken clean audits since inception. No irregular, unauthorised, or fruitless and wasteful expenditure was incurred, and all PFMA submissions were processed within the stipulated deadlines. The Bank retained its external credit ratings of Ba3 (Moody’s) and BB– (S&P), as well as an AA rating from the Association of African Development Finance Institutions (AADFI). 4.154. Development impact metrics indicated a substantial contribution to South Africa’s socio-economic development. During the year, the DBSA facilitated 37,099 jobs, surpassing the target of 24,000; supported 11,231 small, medium, and micro-enterprises (SMMEs), and trained 1,643 youth, with 36,102 learners benefiting from social infrastructure interventions. A total of R4.8 billion in SMME funding was disbursed, of which R2.6 billion was allocated to black women–owned entities, reflecting progress in empowerment and gender transformation. 4.155. The Bank’s developmental operations extended to under-resourced municipalities, where R2.6 billion in infrastructure was unlocked (target: R1.8 billion). In district municipalities, R838 million worth of infrastructure was financed (target: R300 million). DBSA also advanced the just energy transition agenda, with R1.6 billion approved for climate and environmental facility projects (target: R500 million). 4.156. The DBSA’s project preparation and infrastructure delivery units were instrumental in enabling major national and regional projects. Key case studies included the Embedded Generation Investment Programme (EGIP), a renewable energy portfolio of 1,100 MW with a total investment of R7.2 billion; R4 billion in municipal funding under the Integrated Municipal Approach; USD 68 million invested in the Geothermal Energy Project in Kenya; USD 20 million in a multi-country Infrastructure Acceleration Fund; and R6.85 billion in bulk water schemes across South Africa. 4.157. Among its flagship infrastructure initiatives, the Bank financed the Kazungula Water and Sanitation Project (EUR 11.9 million, completed June 2025, benefitting 20,000 residents), and continued major projects such as the Limpopo Central Academic Hospital (R5 billion), Siloam District Hospital (R1.8 billion), and the Parliament Rebuilding Project (R3.6 billion), all of which were within budget and progressing to completion between 2026 and 2028. 4.158. Operational efficiency remained high, with digitalisation and automation of four business processes against a target of three, and successful implementation of a new organisational culture strategy. Stakeholder satisfaction, however, was slightly below target (score: 3.74 out of 4), largely due to calls for faster processing times and broader awareness of DBSA’s service offerings. 4.159. The Bank identified three partially achieved targets during the year: the value of infrastructure delivered (R5.2 billion against R5.6 billion target), the number of transactions committed to black- owned entities (7 out of a target of 8), and stakeholder satisfaction (3.74 against a target of 4). The delays were attributed to payment lags from clients, budget cuts during implementation, and slower conversion of pipeline projects. 4.160. Looking forward, the DBSA aims to expand its impact through targeted investments in energy, water, transport, and digital infrastructure, scale up its Public-Private Partnership (PPP) programmes, and strengthen its role in the Rail Private Sector Participation (PSP) initiative with Transnet and PRASA. 22",

Its mandate is to promote equitable ownership of agricultural land, support agrarian transformation, and contribute to food security by financing and facilitating the participation of historically disadvantaged persons in the agricultural economy. 4.162. During the 2024/25 financial year, the Bank remained in the stabilisation phase (FY23–FY25) of its three-phase turnaround strategy, focused on restoring financial stability, remediating non-performing loans (NPLs), concluding its liability solution, and implementing a sustainable operating model. The liability restructuring process was concluded in September 2024, marking the end of a four-year default period. The Bank’s focus shifted to compliance with restructuring covenants, rebuilding its loan book, and embedding governance reforms 4.163. The gross loan book declined by 12 percent year-on-year, primarily due to conservative lending and ongoing NPL remediation efforts. However, the NPL portfolio decreased from R12.4 billion in 2022 to R8.4 billion in 2025, reflecting steady progress under the remediation strategy. The Bank aims to further reduce NPLs to R6.6 billion by 2028, supported by stronger collections, write-offs, and portfolio reviews. The net interest margin improved to 6.7 percent, while the cost-to-income ratio stood at 43 percent, and the credit loss ratio at 3.6 percent. 4.164. Despite an unsuccessful Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) capital request for FY2025, the Bank continued to engage National Treasury on potential state guarantees and alternative funding models to mitigate projected liquidity risks in FY2027. The Bank achieved 83 percent of its shareholder compact indicators, with 19 achieved and 4 unachieved, while maintaining PFMA compliance and unqualified audit outcomes for all group entities. 4.165. Development effectiveness improved substantially, largely driven by the Blended Finance Scheme (BFS), a public–private partnership aimed at increasing inclusion of historically disadvantaged farmers in commercial agriculture. Since its inception in FY2023, the scheme has approved R3.443 billion in transactions (R1.74 billion loans and R1.703 billion grants). By March 2025, R2.571 billion had been disbursed, R1.281 billion in loans and R1.29 billion in grants, across 423 clients, enabling 784,000 hectares of farmland to enter production. A pipeline of R3.157 billion (R1.766 billion loans and R1.391 billion grants) was in progress, with additional grant funding required to sustain growth. 4.166. The Bank supported several high-impact agricultural enterprises, including Mazeli Farming (Limpopo), a 100 percent black woman-owned business expanding its crop production with Land Bank financing; Mr. Frans Mokoena (Free State), who expanded his farm from 807 to 2,838 hectares through BFS support; and Elmboog Organic Farming (Northern Cape), which transitioned from a failed restitution project to a top-tier raisin producer employing over 300 workers. These success stories reflect the Bank’s progress in translating its developmental mandate into measurable socio-economic outcomes. 4.167. On institutional capacity, 97.5 percent of staff were placed under the new structure, with a vacancy rate of 3.4 percent. The Bank implemented a Performance Management Policy (March 2025) and a Culture Change Framework (approved March 2025). It re-engineered three core business processes, loan origination, collateral management, and facility restructuring, all approved by Executive Committee in March 2025. These reforms contributed to improvements in turnaround times and strengthened client-centricity. 4.168. Financial sustainability indicators showed improvement.

The Land Bank Group, comprising the parent bank and its subsidiaries Land Bank Insurance Company (LBIC) and Land Bank Life Insurance Company (LBLIC), achieved unqualified audit opinions with findings for 2024/25. Although not yet at clean-audit level, remediation measures were underway focusing on automation and data integrity improvements.

The Statement of Financial Position reflected total assets of R4.92 billion, up 7 percent from R4.62 billion in 2023/24, while total liabilities decreased by 11 percent to R520 million, primarily due to lease and long-term incentive payments. The PIC carried no long-term debt, maintaining a strong balance sheet position. 4.183. The audit outcome for 2024/25 was unqualified with material findings, unchanged from the prior year. The AGSA raised material findings on performance information and compliance with Section 10(1) of the PIC Act regarding AuM investment processes, and on non-prevention of irregular expenditure in terms of Section 51(1)(b)(ii) of the PFMA. 4.184. The management report contained 40 audit findings, compared to 33 in 2023/24, with improvements in IT controls but regressions in procurement and compliance alignment with the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (PPFA), 2022. A corrective action plan was approved, including a full procurement policy review, delegation of authority alignment, enhanced governance training, and quarterly register audits. 4.185. The PIC recorded R20.02 million in fruitless and wasteful expenditure, up from R349,000 in 2023/24, mainly due to the Voluntary Disclosure Programme (VDP) settlement with SARS on historic VAT apportionments. The total VAT repayment was R27.89 million, with R16.3 million in interest paid and R9.76 million in penalties fully remitted by SARS, closing the long-standing compliance matter. 4.186. Two Material Irregularities (MIs) were confirmed by the AGSA in 2024/25, involving Daybreak Farm (Pty) Ltd and Enable Capital Receivables Finance (ECRF) (Pty) Ltd. In the Daybreak case, the PIC invested R1.7 billion, plus R150 million post-commencement finance (PCF) to prevent liquidation, while a R250 million additional investment was made in February 2025. The entity entered business rescue in June 2025, with a creditor-approved turnaround plan by September 2025. The ECRF matter involved a R200 million facility, with R100 million disbursed in 2024; subsequent default led to business rescue and a High Court judgment in favour of the PIC for R108.9 million plus interest. 4.187. The unlisted investment portfolio stood at R71 billion, comprising 153 active investments across clients (GEPF 79 percent, UIF 19 percent, and CF 3 percent). Capital repayments of R43 billion had been received, derisking 43 percent of the portfolio, and the 2022 GEPF unlisted allocation achieved a 16 percent internal rate of return (IRR) as at 31 March 2025. Top performing investments included Old Mutual Private Equity (35 percent IRR), Siyanda Resources (29 percent), Jasper Solar (27 percent), and Africa Capital Works (21 percent). 4.188. The unlisted property portfolio was valued at R58.9 billion, representing 397 assets with a combined gross lettable area of 4.8 million m² and year-on-year asset growth of 15.6 percent. The portfolio composition included retail (53 percent), office (22 percent), specialised (17 percent), industrial (5 percent), and student accommodation (2 percent) properties. 4.189. In terms of social impact, the PIC’s investments facilitated 200,556 jobs, up from 190,258 in the previous year, with 49,456 occupied by women and 85,757 by men. Sectoral contributions included 31,433 jobs in agriculture, 21,295 in financial services, 12,819 in mining, 9,088 in construction, 8,000 in healthcare, and 7,907 in property and retail. Housing investments financed 72,099 housing units, including 6,521 social and affordable units through partnerships with GPF and Royal Bafokeng Properties. 4.190. On transformation, 87 percent of total funds were allocated to black economic empowerment (BEE) firms, and R3.7 billion was allocated to transformed fund managers since 2022. Of seven multi- managed funds, five achieved Level 2 B-BBEE status or better. The PIC employed 443 staff members, 55 percent of whom were women. Africans constituted 86.23 percent of total staff, while women represented 41 percent of senior and top management. A total of R5.7 million was disbursed for bursaries, funding 51 students nationally, 76 percent of whom were women. 4.191. The Corporation declared a dividend of R145 million to the shareholder (National Treasury), up from R141 million in 2023/24, and maintained financial assets (cash reserves) of R3.6 billion.

The Financial and Fiscal Commission is a constitutional advisory institution established in terms of Section 220 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, and governed by the Financial and Fiscal Commission Act, 1997 (Act No. 99 of 1997). The FFC’s mandate is to make recommendations to Parliament, provincial legislatures, and organs of state on financial and fiscal matters, including the equitable division of nationally raised revenue among the three spheres of government and the design of intergovernmental fiscal relations frameworks. 5.2. During the 2024/25 financial year, the FFC sustained an unqualified audit opinion for the third consecutive year, with material findings on compliance relating to procurement processes and expenditure management. These findings stemmed from delayed supplier payments, weak record- keeping, and late submission of annual financial statements (AFS) and performance reports to the Audit Committee. Despite these control weaknesses, the AGSA confirmed that all material misstatements in the AFS and annual performance report (APR) were corrected during the audit process, and no material findings were raised on the usefulness or reliability of reported performance information. 5.3. The FFC achieved 85.7 percent of its performance indicators (14 of 16 targets). Programme 1 (Administration) met 77.8 percent (7 of 9 indicators), while Programme 2 (Research) achieved 100 percent (7 of 7 indicators). The FFC met all key research deliverables, including its Annual Submission on the Division of Revenue, Technical Research Report, policy briefs, and submissions on the Appropriation Bill and the MTBPS. These outputs collectively informed Parliament’s deliberations on fiscal policy, public finance reforms, and intergovernmental transfers. 5.4.

However, liquidity improved significantly, with cash and cash equivalents rising by 68.8 percent from R16.47 million to R27.79 million, and net cash flow from operations moving from a negative R10.24 million in 2023/24 to a positive R11.38 million in 2024/25. The creditor payment period improved from 54 to 43 days, although compliance with the 30-day requirement remained a challenge. 5.5. Key governance changes were implemented to stabilise operations. The Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Duncan Thulani Ntuli) and Chief Financial Officer (Ms. Ansuyah Maharaj-Dowra) were appointed during the year, filling positions that had been vacant in the prior cycle. These appointments are expected to strengthen the internal control environment and financial governance. The Audit Committee’s oversight was constrained by the delayed submission of the AFS and APR, limiting timely review before audit submission, but corrective measures have since been introduced. 5.6. The FFC identified vacancies and skills shortages in the finance and supply chain management units as the main cause of recurring audit findings. Recruitment for finance and SCM support staff is underway, and interim oversight has been assigned to manage procurement and contract variation controls. A credible audit improvement plan has been adopted, incorporating monthly reconciliations, GRAP compliance checklists, and SOP implementation to address recurring deficiencies. These actions are monitored quarterly by the Audit and Risk Committee, supported by the Internal Audit function. 27",

Continuous engagement with National Treasury and the Standing Committee on Finance will remain central to ensuring evidence-based fiscal policy advice. SOUTH AFRICAN RESERVE BANK GROUP OVERVIEW (2024/25) 5.12. The South African Reserve Bank is the central bank of the Republic of South Africa, established under the Currency and Banking Act of 1921 and currently governed by the South African Reserve Bank Act, 1989 (Act No. 90 of 1989). Its constitutional mandate, in terms of Section 224 of the Constitution, is to protect the value of the currency in the interest of balanced and sustainable economic growth. The SARB carries out this function through monetary policy, financial stability oversight, prudential supervision, payment-system management, and the holding of official gold and foreign-exchange reserves. It also acts as banker to government and provides settlement facilities to the financial system. 5.13. The SARB functions as a group consisting of the central bank and four main subsidiaries: the South African Bank Note Company, the South African Mint (including the Prestige Bullion joint venture with Rand Refinery), the Corporation for Public Deposits, and the Corporation for Deposit Insurance. The Bank also holds a 50 percent strategic shareholding in African Bank Holdings Limited (ABHL), accounted for using the equity method. The SARB Group forms the core of South Africa’s financial- stability safety net together with the Prudential Authority (PA), Financial Sector Conduct Authority, and Financial Intelligence Centre. 5.14. For the 2024/25 financial year, the SARB Group achieved 95 percent of its performance indicators and received an unqualified audit opinion with no material findings from its independent external auditors, BDO and SNG Grant Thornton. The group financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Total assets increased by 6.8 percent to R1.61 trillion, while total liabilities rose by 5.9 percent to R1.52 trillion, resulting in group equity of R86.2 billion at 31 March 2025. The increase in assets was mainly due to higher foreign-reserve holdings and valuation gains under the Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account (GFECRA). 5.15. Group income rose to R40.7 billion from R37.4 billion in 2023/24, largely reflecting higher interest income on reserves and domestic investments. Operating expenditure increased by 5.4 percent to R18.6 billion, mainly because of inflationary adjustments and information-technology modernisation. The group posted a net profit of R4.3 billion, up from R3.7 billion the previous year. In accordance with the SARB Act, dividends of R200,000 were paid to private shareholders, with R3.9 billion transferred to the National Revenue Fund.

The Committee notes that the Finance Portfolio shows a moderate improvement in clean audit outcomes for the 2024/25 financial year. According to the Auditor-General South Africa (AGSA), 70 percent of entities within the portfolio achieved clean audits, up from 65 percent in 2023/24, while the remainder obtained unqualified opinions with findings. The audit for the Government Pensions Administration Agency (GPAA) remained outstanding at the time of reporting. The Committee welcomes the improved timeliness of annual financial statement submissions and the general strengthening of compliance controls across most entities. 29",

SARS achieved 86 percent of its annual performance indicators (19 of 22), up from 84 percent in 2023/24, reflecting improved delivery across strategic objectives. While performance in audit and transfer-pricing reviews was constrained by limited capacity, strong results were achieved in digitalisation, taxpayer services, and voluntary compliance. The Committee reiterated that strengthening specialised capacity in audit, data analytics, and transfer pricing remains essential to sustaining long-term compliance improvements. 6.21. The Committee notes that SARS continues to support the implementation of the two-pot retirement system in collaboration with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and National Treasury, ensuring regulatory and systems readiness.

It commends the FIC’s leadership in coordinating risk-based supervision across financial and non-financial sectors but emphasises that the post-greylisting phase must prioritise sustained enforcement and measurable support by FIC data to convictions, asset recoveries and deterrence. 6.34. The Committee notes that total expenditure for 2024/25 comprised approximately R247.7 million in personnel costs, R170.5 million in operating expenses and R23.9 million in capital expenditure. These figures reflect prudent financial management and efficient utilisation of available resources. 6.35. The Committee acknowledges the FIC’s contribution to multi-agency cooperation through platforms such as the Fusion Centre, the Asset-Recovery Hub and the Shared Forensic Capability. These initiatives have enhanced coordination between the FIC, the National Prosecuting Authority, the South African Police Service and the South African Revenue Service. The Committee encourages continued collaboration to ensure that intelligence referrals translate into tangible enforcement outcomes. 6.36. The Committee notes that 556 inspections were conducted across accountable institutions during the year, resulting in administrative sanctions of approximately R2.2 million imposed by the FIC, in addition to penalties levied by other supervisory authorities. The Committee urges intensified supervisory attention and training for higher-risk non-financial sectors to strengthen compliance with customer-due-diligence and reporting obligations. 6.37.

    "recommendation": "that arrear contributions undermine members’ rights to full retirement benefits and threaten fund solvency in the municipal sector. 6.49. The Committee recommends that National Treasury, SALGA, and the FSCA jointly submit a remedial action plan within three months, identifying high-risk municipalities, repayment timelines, and disciplinary measures for persistent non-compliance. 6.50. The Committee notes that unclaimed financial assets amount to approximately R30.1 billion across about three million members, with the majority of cases concentrated in 60 retirement funds. The Committee welcomes the FSCA’s initiative to establish a central database of unclaimed assets and standardise tracing processes. However, progress remains at an early stage, and data quality continues to limit verification and beneficiary tracing. 6.51. The Committee recommends that the FSCA and National Treasury finalise the regulatory framework for unclaimed financial assets by March 2026, including the assignment of clear roles and accountability for tracing, disbursement, and disclosure, and ensure that the centralised database becomes operational by mid-2026. 6.52. The Committee notes that the FSCA continues to expand its supervision of fintech and crypto-asset markets, having licensed 10 crypto-asset service providers in 2024/25 and launched a regulatory sandbox to encourage innovation under controlled conditions. The Committee welcomes these developments but stresses that rapid digitalisation requires stronger cybersecurity protocols and consumer safeguards to prevent systemic and retail risks. 6.53. The Committee recommends that the FSCA table an annual fintech and digital-finance risk report to Parliament, detailing regulatory gaps, consumer-protection cases, and inter-agency coordination with the Prudential Authority and South African Reserve Bank on digital-asset supervision. 6.54. The Committee notes that the FSCA employs 681 staff members, of whom 51 percent are women and 91 percent are black, with women constituting 75 percent of the executive team. The Committee commends the Authority for achieving employment equity targets but notes that turnover in technical units remains high due to competitive private-sector demand. 6.55. The Committee recommends that the FSCA prioritise retention and succession planning strategies for scarce technical skills, expand graduate and bursary programmes, and report annually on progress in staff retention, leadership diversity, and institutional capacity-building. PRUDENTIAL AUTHORITY 6.56. The Committee notes that the Prudential Authority continues to provide stability to the banking and insurance supervisory environment under the Twin Peaks model. The prudential framework remains aligned with international standards, with continued supervisory emphasis on capital adequacy, liquidity resilience, asset quality, governance and risk management across banks, insurers and systemically important non-bank financial institutions. 6.57. The Committee observes that South Africa’s post-resolution architecture, anchored in the Financial Sector Laws Amendment Act and the operationalisation of deposit insurance, has materially strengthened the safety-net for retail depositors and enhanced orderly-resolution readiness for systemic firms. The Authority’s ongoing work on recovery and resolution planning for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and selected insurers is welcomed, but fuller visibility on testing outcomes and inter-agency coordination (including with the Resolution Authority, SARB Financial Stability function and National Treasury) would assist parliamentary oversight. 6.58. The Committee notes that bank capital and liquidity positions remain sound at the system level, with prudential ratios above minimum requirements, notwithstanding headwinds from weak growth, load- shedding legacies, logistics constraints and higher-for-longer interest rates. Credit risk remains elevated in specific portfolios (household unsecured credit, small business lending and certain commercial real-estate segments). The Authority’s use of targeted stress testing and thematic reviews is appropriate; however, more granular supervisory feedback to the market on concentration 35",

The regulator oversees about 74 000 statutory audits annually, including 2 000 public interest entity (PIE) audits, which are of paramount importance due to their systemic impact on investors, employees, and the economy. The Committee welcomes the IRBA’s proactive engagement with over 40 audit committees during the reporting year, a measure that strengthens oversight of auditor independence and quality. 6.97. During the 2024/25 financial year, the IRBA received 636 reportable irregularities (RIs), two-thirds of which were referred to other regulators. The primary issues identified were non-compliance with tax obligations (44 %) and violations of the Companies Act (24 %). The Committee commends the IRBA for initiating an annual publication to track the resolution of these irregularities, a practice that enhances transparency and reinforces the accountability of both auditors and audited entities. 6.98. The Committee commends the IRBA’s documented progress in improving audit quality.

The Committee stresses that achieving representativity at the executive level remains a priority and recommends the implementation of a clear succession plan to address this. 6.100. The Committee further notes the significant growth in the candidate auditor pipeline, which increased from 123 to 205 in 2024/25, aided by reduced registration fees and enhanced outreach. This pipeline is increasingly diverse, with 52 % of candidates from African, Coloured, or Indian backgrounds and 53 % being female. The Committee welcomes this progress and encourages the IRBA to deepen collaboration with professional bodies like SAICA and ACCA to further expand opportunities for Black and female auditors. 6.101. The Committee expresses concern regarding threats to auditor safety from corruption and criminal syndicates, particularly within the public sector. While acknowledging that the IRBA’s mandate does not include security provision, the Committee recommends that it continue to collaborate with law enforcement and professional bodies to ensure auditors can perform their duties free from intimidation or undue pressure. 6.102. The Committee takes note of the IRBA’s sound financial position, with total revenue of R209.8 million, approximately 72 % of which was derived from fees and levies. The IRBA clarified that accumulated surpluses are retained, with National Treasury’s approval, to fund potentially high-cost disciplinary proceedings. The Committee notes this prudent fiscal approach but recommends that the IRBA provide annual disclosure on the proportion of reserves ring-fenced for enforcement to enhance transparency. 6.103. The Committee further notes improvements in enforcement performance, with the IRBA exceeding its target by finalising over 80 investigations and achieving a 90 % disciplinary completion rate. These results are welcomed as evidence of a more responsive regulatory environment, bolstered by legislative amendments that allow for non-audit matters to be referred to professional bodies for resolution. 6.104. The Committee recommends that the IRBA continue its annual publication of reportable irregularity and enforcement statistics disaggregated by sector and violation type; deepen collaboration with the FSCA, FIC, and SARS to strengthen its referral network and improve the timeliness of cross- regulatory action; and brief Parliament annually on trends in audit quality, enforcement outcomes, and transformation within the profession. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD 6.105. The Committee acknowledges the statutory mandate of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) to develop, issue and promote high-quality accounting standards for all spheres of government, as provided for in section 89 of the Public Finance Management Act (1999). The Committee welcomes the ASB’s clean audit opinion for the 2024/25 financial year, achieved since the entity’s inception, which reflects continued sound governance, fiscal discipline and adherence to effective internal- control systems. 6.106. The Committee notes that the ASB achieved 10 of 14 planned outputs (approximately 71 percent) for the year, compared with 64 percent in 2023/24. Key achievements included maintaining and updating the Standards of Generally Recognised Accounting Practice (GRAP), strengthening implementation guidance, and advancing work toward the long-term transition of the public sector to accrual-based financial reporting. The Committee commends this improvement in performance and consistency in technical delivery despite limited resources. 6.107. The Committee welcomes the ASB’s continued technical alignment with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB). During 2024/25 the ASB completed projects on revenue, leases and financial instruments, and contributed to international deliberations through responses to IPSASB exposure drafts. Implementation guidance for GRAP 109 (Accounting by Principals and Agents) and GRAP 25 (Employee Benefits) was also advanced, contributing to improved quality and comparability of public-sector financial statements. 6.108. The Committee commends the ASB’s expanded outreach and stakeholder-engagement initiatives, which recorded a 33 percent increase in engagements compared to the previous year.

This inclusive approach ensures that South Africa’s GRAP framework remains robust, credible and responsive to the evolving needs of the public sector. 6.111. The Committee notes the ASB’s progress in developing a Post-Implementation Review Framework, which will provide an evidence-based mechanism for evaluating the cost-effectiveness, impact and implementation challenges of GRAP standards. The Committee supports the timely operationalisation of this framework as part of continuous improvement in public-sector accounting. 6.112. The Committee acknowledges that the ASB continues to deliver technically rigorous outputs through a lean organisational structure of highly skilled personnel. To safeguard institutional capability, the Committee underscores the importance of succession planning, retention of technical expertise and the creation of specialist career-development pathways. 6.113. The Committee recommends that the ASB deepen its collaboration with the Auditor-General of South Africa, provincial treasuries and municipal CFO forums to promote consistent application of GRAP standards and strengthen institutional readiness for accrual accounting. The ASB should report annually to Parliament on the progress of accrual reforms, capacity-building outcomes and challenges faced by preparers. 6.114. The Committee further recommends that National Treasury review the ASB’s funding model to secure its long-term sustainability and that the ASB finalise and implement its Post-Implementation Review Framework to evaluate systematically the effectiveness of GRAP standards in enhancing accountability, transparency and comparability across the public sector. GOVERNMENT TECHNICAL ADVISORY CENTRE 6.115. The Committee notes that the Government Technical Advisory Centre (GTAC) continues to serve as a critical technical arm of the National Treasury, established in terms of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and the 2015 GTAC Regulations, to provide advisory, analytical, and programme management support to organs of state. GTAC’s work aligns with national strategic priorities, including infrastructure development, public expenditure efficiency, and job creation. 6.116. The Committee observes that GTAC achieved an unqualified audit opinion for the 2024/25 financial year, maintaining its record of sound financial governance. The entity achieved 93 percent of its performance indicators and continued to demonstrate operational efficiency across its advisory and programme management functions. Revenue amounted to R204 million, with expenditure of R198 million, resulting in a surplus of R6 million. GTAC’s income sources were composed of cost-recovery fees (46 percent), voted funds (28 percent), and interest income (22 percent). 6.117. The Committee notes that GTAC completed 22 spending reviews during 2024/25, covering R142.2 billion in public expenditure, including four reviews focused on the compensation of employees. The Centre also undertook 16 consulting and technical support projects valued at R56 million, and through the Jobs Fund, managed 101 projects valued at R65 million, cumulatively creating 337 534 jobs at an average cost of R23 500 per job. The Committee welcomes this contribution to job creation and notes that the Jobs Fund continues to leverage public and private funding. 6.118. The Committee further notes that GTAC’s Infrastructure and Project Preparation Facility supported the assessment of 15 Budget Facility for Infrastructure (BFI) projects valued at approximately R149 billion, and 27 priority infrastructure projects valued at R35 billion per annum. The Centre’s Infrastructure Hub facilitated tenders exceeding R2 billion annually, contributing to the improved quality and feasibility of project appraisals across the state. 6.119. The Committee notes that GTAC maintained high levels of client satisfaction, with 91 percent of government clients rating GTAC’s services as “satisfied” or “very satisfied.” Repeat engagements accounted for 38 percent of projects. The Committee notes that GTAC’s workforce remains highly qualified, with 44 percent of staff holding postgraduate qualifications and 56 percent being female. 6.120. The Committee expresses concern over the continued delays in payments to GTAC by client departments, which affects the Centre’s liquidity and sustainability. GTAC reported that 70 percent of 41",

DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SOUTHERN AFRICA 6.126. The Committee acknowledges the Development Bank of Southern Africa’s (DBSA) critical role as a state-owned development finance institution established under the DBSA Act (No. 13 of 1997) and operating as part of the national infrastructure ecosystem under the shareholder oversight of the National Treasury. The Bank’s mandate to promote inclusive infrastructure-led growth, build municipal capacity, and support regional integration remains central to the government’s development objectives. 6.127. The Committee notes the DBSA’s clean audit outcome for the 2024/25 financial year, maintaining a record of unqualified audits since its inception. The Bank continues to demonstrate stability at the board and executive levels, supported by an embedded culture of accountability and a comprehensive compliance framework. 6.128. The Committee notes that the DBSA met most of its headline key performance indicators for 2024/25, including a return on equity of 9.3 percent, a cost-to-income ratio of 19.3 percent for the financing business (well below the 35-percent benchmark), and total disbursements of R17.5 billion against a target of R14.5 billion. Total revenue amounted to R13.45 billion, while net profit increased to R5.32 billion. The Bank’s total assets stood at R121 billion, supported by a liquidity position of R15 billion and a capital-leverage ratio of 78 percent, significantly below the prudential ceiling of 250 percent. Although the value of infrastructure delivered reached R5.2 billion, this fell short of the R5.6 billion target by approximately R400 million. 6.129. The Committee welcomes the Bank’s continued financial soundness, underscored by positive ratings from Moody’s and S&P and the retention of Green Climate Fund (GCF) accreditation. It notes that approximately 70 percent of the loan book (R79 billion) is invested in South Africa, while",

The Committee recommends that the Bank intensify oversight of project-execution timelines and ensure that budgeted resources yield timely and measurable outputs. 6.136. The Committee further notes public and Member concerns regarding delays and governance issues in the reconstruction of Parliament and other projects under the Bank’s implementation. The DBSA informed the Committee that the revised project milestone for Parliament targets practical completion by November 2026 and full commissioning by early 2027. The Committee stresses the importance of strict oversight, transparent reporting, and independent quality assurance to ensure accountability, value for money, and protection of workers’ rights on all outsourced projects. 6.137. The Committee acknowledges that the DBSA continues to implement robust risk-management practices, with its Audit and Risk Committee functioning independently and regularly assessing strategic and operational risks. Liquidity and credit risks remain well controlled, but the Committee emphasises that the Bank must maintain vigilant oversight of its municipal lending portfolio and implement enhanced credit-risk analytics to detect potential defaults early. 6.138. The Committee welcomes the DBSA’s transformation achievements, with 53 percent female representation and 88 percent black representation among its 1 001 employees. It also notes the development of youth-focused programmes in the construction sector aimed at empowering young entrepreneurs and creating employment pathways for graduates lacking experience. 6.139. The Committee notes the clarification provided by the DBSA regarding its previous memorandum of understanding with the sanctioned Russian bank VEB.RF. The Bank confirmed that no credit facilities, financial transactions, or investments exist under this MOU. The Committee calls for continued vigilance to ensure full compliance with international sanctions and anti-money-laundering frameworks. 6.140. The Committee recommends that the DBSA: (a) Accelerate the conversion of prepared projects into implementation through enhanced feasibility planning and intergovernmental coordination, including increasing its institutional capacity (b) Report quarterly to Parliament on the Infrastructure Fund’s financial commitments, disbursements, and catalytic impacts. (c) Implement a comprehensive review of project-management practices to address delays and cost overruns, including the Parliament rebuild. 43",

PUBLIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION 6.154. The Committee acknowledges the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) as South Africa’s largest asset manager and a critical anchor of the domestic financial system. As at 31 March 2025, the PIC manages R3.05 trillion in assets under management (AUM) on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund, the Unemployment Insurance Fund, the Compensation Funds, and several other clients. This represents a 13.3 percent increase from R2.69 trillion in 2023/24, primarily driven by strong equity-market performance, reinvested investment income, and steady inflows from its public-sector clients. 6.155. The Committee notes that the GEPF remains the PIC’s dominant client, accounting for R2.68 trillion or 87.8 percent of total AUM, followed by the UIF at 5.6 percent (R170 billion), the Compensation Funds and Compensation Commissioner combined at 4.4 percent (R133 billion), and smaller clients contributing 2.2 percent (R66 billion). This composition underscores the PIC’s systemic significance within the public-sector pension environment and the need for prudent liquidity management and diversification of mandates to mitigate concentration risk. 6.156. The Committee notes that the PIC obtained an unqualified audit opinion with material findings for the 2024/25 financial year, the same outcome as the prior year.

The Committee notes that the PIC achieved 95 percent of its annual performance targets, compared to 90 percent in 2023/24. Total income increased by 8 percent to R1.66 billion, driven by a 4 percent increase in management fees and a 27 percent rise in other income, mainly from investee companies. Net profit rose by 89 percent to R512 million, reflecting improved investment performance and operational efficiency. The cost-to-income ratio stood at 41 percent, with personnel and ICT modernisation costs accounting for the bulk of expenditure. 6.158. The Committee notes the two material irregularities raised by the Auditor-General concerning Daybreak Foods (Pty) Ltd and Enable Capital Receivables Finance (Pty) Ltd, both linked to governance lapses in unlisted investments. The PIC is required to submit the four forensic reports on Daybreak Foods to Parliament, together with the corresponding law-enforcement referral details and case numbers, by 02 December 2025. 6.159. The Committee welcomes the PIC’s progress in implementing the Mpati Commission of Inquiry recommendations, particularly regarding governance, transparency, and risk management. The revised Investment Policy Framework, updated Client Mandate Charters, and Lifestyle Audit Policy for executives have been finalised. The Committee requires a comprehensive written report mapping each Mpati recommendation to its implementation status, law-enforcement referrals, and reasons where no referral was made, to be submitted by 02 December 2025. 6.160. The Committee notes that the active unlisted investment portfolio totals approximately R71 billion, comprising 153 active investments across the GEPF (79 percent), UIF (19 percent), and Compensation Funds (3 percent). The total committed capital stands at R111 billion, of which R99 billion has been invested and R43 billion repaid. The unlisted portfolio achieved an internal rate of return of 16 percent on the 2022 GEPF unlisted allocation. The Committee therefore requires the PIC to submit a full schedule of current valuations and methodologies applied for 2024/25, including details of independent validations, by 02 December 2025. 6.161. The Committee further requires a comprehensive schedule of all unlisted property investments, including the date of purchase, vendor or entity from whom each asset was acquired, purchase price, current valuation, and impairment history, together with a technical memorandum outlining the year-end valuation methodology applied for 2024/25, to be submitted by 02 December 2025. 6.162. The Committee notes with concern the levels of impairments and distressed assets within the unlisted portfolio. The PIC must submit a detailed breakdown of total impairments, percentage share relative to total unlisted assets, underlying reasons for impairments, and mitigation measures instituted to reduce exposure to future losses, by 02 December 2025. 6.163. The Committee requires that the PIC disclose the total value of investments that experienced non- compliance with internal investment policies and relevant legislation during 2024/25, including a sectoral distribution of affected transactions and remedial actions undertaken, by 02 December 2025. 6.164. The Committee requests that the PIC provide empirical evidence explaining the reported low demand for SMME finance, including application volumes, approval rates, decline rates, ticket sizes, turnaround times, and identified barriers to access. This report should also outline the corrective measures being developed to increase inclusivity and credit access for small and medium enterprises, by 02 December 2025. 6.165. The Committee welcomes the PIC’s continued commitment to transformation in the financial sector. During 2024/25, R146 billion in assets were allocated to black-owned asset managers, up from R133 billion the previous year. Eighty-seven percent of asset managers now meet at least a Level 2 B-BBEE rating. The Committee urges the PIC to deepen partnerships with black and women-owned asset managers through mentorship and incubation programmes to promote sectoral equity and transformation. 6.166. The Committee commends the PIC’s strong financial performance, recording R3.05 trillion in AUM, R1.66 billion in revenue, and a net profit of R512 million. However, credibility will ultimately depend on transparent disclosure, timely consequence management, and the demonstration of corrective action. 6.167. The Committee will conduct an oversight visit to the PIC focused on unlisted investment governance, valuation practices, and implementation of the Mpati Commission recommendations during the 2025/26 financial year. 46",

The Committee affirms that this 2024/25 Budgetary Review and Recommendations Report (BRRR) constitutes a comprehensive evaluation of the performance, governance, and financial sustainability of the National Treasury and the entities and institutions within the Finance Portfolio. These include constitutional institutions, regulatory bodies, state-owned financial entities, and development finance institutions that collectively underpin South Africa’s fiscal stability, financial integrity, and economic transformation agenda. 7.2. The Committee recognises that while the National Treasury provides the overarching framework for fiscal policy, public finance management, and economic governance, several institutions within the portfolio, such as the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), and the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA), exercise constitutionally or statutorily independent mandates. This institutional diversity reflects the constitutional design of South Africa’s financial governance architecture, which balances accountability, operational autonomy, and developmental imperatives. 7.3. The Committee will process and adopt its report on the oversight visit to the South African Reserve Bank Group and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority in early December, before the end of the current parliamentary term. 7.4.

    "recommendation": "that make it difficult to accurately forecast GDP growth figures but recommends that the National Treasury draw in more independent expertise in its forecasting process to improve the credibility of the fiscal framework and better manage the economic and fiscal risks associated with its forecasts. The National Treasury uses various models to generate economic forecasts, including inflation, terms of trade, sector and business cycle models. They supplement the main macroeconomic forecast model, which is a large semi-structural econometric model similar to those used by the Reserve Bank and the Bureau for Economic Research. The assumptions that are used in the main model are sourced from global institutions or determined internally through a rigorous assumptions process. The model is regularly updated to capture changes in the South African and global economy. The Economic Policy division is engaging with the Bureau for Economic Research to assess and improve the model. Other models that are used for policy analysis and research are also maintained and updated. These are less appropriate for forecasting, but are still used to analyse trade-offs of policy and other shocks to the economy to better inform the forecast process. Since 2014, forecast errors from the National Treasury and market analysts have been decreasing. Independent studies show that National Treasury forecasts are on par with, or better than, market projections. It should also be noted that no institution has had consistently accurate forecasts over time.1 The Minister of Finance agreed that high debt now will burden future generations if it is not managed properly and the situation is unsustainable. We therefore require the National Treasury to report quarterly on the effectiveness of its debt management strategies, that would ensure that the level of debt stabilises over the medium term as the current situation is not sustainable. Rising fiscal deficits over the past decade have increased government’s borrowing requirements and debt-to-GDP ratio. Accordingly, the only way to lower the debt-to-GDP ratio is through consistently higher economic growth or lower spending. Government’s prudent debt management strategy enables it to manage the risks associated with elevated borrowing. Debt management is guided by strategic risk benchmarks for refinancing, interest, inflation and currency risks.",

Irregular expenditure increased from R52.7 billion in 2017/18 to R61.4 billion in 2018/19.

    "recommendation": "• Take disciplinary steps against officials who make or permit irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure. In 2018, the National Treasury issued an irregular expenditure framework as an instruction, which was revised in May 2019. It sets out procedures for disciplining officials accused of financial misconduct and, where applicable, recovering funds and laying criminal charges. These disciplinary steps are required before such expenditure may be condoned. Amendments to the Public Audit Act (2004), which took effect on 1 April 2019, empower the Auditor- General to refer any suspected material irregularities for investigation. They also empower the Auditor- General to take appropriate remedial action and to issue a certificate of debt where an accounting officer or accounting authority has failed to comply with remedial action. The South African Revenue Service (SARS) needs to develop its policies and capacity to tax the digital economy more effectively and is required to report on this to the committee at the first quarterly briefing of 2020. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation and will report as requested. Officials from both the National Treasury and SARS have been engaging with other countries to find global consensus on how to ensure that profit from digitised business models is taxed appropriately. The aim of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development committee responsible for making recommendations in this area is to reach consensus on a new international tax architecture in 2020. South Africa is represented on the committee. SARS needs to work together with the relevant stakeholders to address the root causes of fiscal leakages emanating from, but not limited to, Road Accident Fund claims, medico legal claims and police litigations, particularly those resulting mainly from negligence. SARS will continue to engage with stakeholders on limiting the fiscal leakages cited by the committee. For example, SARS participates in an inter-agency working group with the Department of Trade and Industry and the National Treasury that focuses on tackling illicit trade, particularly in the clothing and textile industry. The committee notes with concern the direct impacts of incorrect economic growth forecasts on tax revenue collection by SARS. We are concerned that the revenue shortfall increases from a projected R14.5 billion in 2018/19 to R52.5 billion in 2019/20 and R84 billion in 2020/21 and that the scope for further tax increases has also narrowed. The National Treasury should support SARS more actively, ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 111 including financially and in rebuilding the organisation without interfering in its operational matters. SARS, the National Treasury and law enforcement agencies need to work far more effectively in processing cases against any staff members legitimately accused of financial misconduct and corruption. The final revenue shortfall for 2018/19 was R57.3 billion compared to 2018 Budget estimates, and based on the audited revenue outcomes for 2018/19. The significant downward revisions to the economic and revenue outlook since the 2019 Budget are mainly the result of weaker economic performance. Tax revenue collection estimates published in the Budget Review and MTBPS are projections, rather than targets. If assumptions are not realised or economic performance is different than projected, these revenue estimates are subsequently revised. In the 2019 MTBPS, the National Treasury proposed additional allocations of R1 billion over three years for SARS to rebuild capacity, improve operations, and implement critical projects and recommendations from the Nugent Commission. Investigations into financial misconduct and corruption are ongoing. The National Treasury and SARS presented a progress report to the Standing Committee on Finance about implementing the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by SARS. The committee is concerned about a constantly increasing gross debt-to-GDP ratio, a projected increase from R3.2 trillion in 2019/20 reaching R4.5 trillion in 2022/23 (71 per cent by 2023) as this is likely to burden future generations if concerted efforts are not made to sustainably reduce it.

    "recommendation": "2009 recession, is a cause for concern, since there does not appear to be a point of stabilisation over the medium term. The committee also notes that debt service costs have become the fastest-growing expenditure item, costing the national fiscus R203.7 billion per annum (13.7 per cent) in 2019/20 and are expected to reach almost R300 billion in 2022/23. These funds could be utilised for other competing economic and social needs. The committee recommends that the National Treasury do far more to incrementally reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio and report on progress on this at its quarterly briefings. In the 2019 MTBPS, government proposed achieving a main budget primary balance by 2022/23. Achieving the fiscal target requires making large additional adjustments to the fiscal framework exceeding R150 billion in total over the medium term. These adjustments would need to address growth in the public-service wage bill and include a sustainable plan for state-owned companies in order to reduce future transfers. Given the size of the required adjustment, additional tax measures were considered. These measures require making difficult decisions that will affect the economy and the distribution of public resources. The committee notes that the 2019 MTBPS budgeted contingency reserves amount to R18 billion over the medium term, or R6 billion each year. These amounts are not adequate and are likely to leave South Africa susceptible to external and internal shocks in an event of unforeseen circumstances such as imminent dangers of food insecurity and water scarcity, including through potential floods and drought. The committee urges the National Treasury to quantify and factor in these potential risks in the economic growth forecasts and the overall fiscal framework. The National Treasury assesses fiscal risks to identify and plan for unexpected and uncertain events. This process informs the formulation of the fiscal framework and culminates in the publication of an annual fiscal risk statement. The contingency reserve is part of the expenditure ceiling and is determined within this overall limit. Its size depends on available resources and the level of uncertainty and is revised during the budget process. Analysis in the 2013 Budget Review showed that unforeseen and unavoidable expenditure adjustments, for which the contingency reserve was budgeted, averaged R4 billion per year over five years. This was much lower than the contingency reserve amounts, which were then lowered. In addition to the contingency reserve, there are disaster relief grants for local and provincial government. In the past, the combination of the contingency reserve, the disaster relief grants and other",

    "recommendation": "2020 BUDGET REVIEW 112 ring-fenced funds within infrastructure grants has proven sufficient to meet the costs associated with natural disasters. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Adjustments Appropriation Bill The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury carefully scrutinises government departments’ ability to spend allocated funds before submitting budget proposals to Parliament in order to prevent continued underspending on allocated funds as it has implications for government debt and the interest payments. Over the past 25 years the National Treasury has developed a rigorous budget process that imposes the highest level of scrutiny to ensure that departments have the ability to spend allocated funds. The Constitution mandates the National Treasury to manage public finances, and the Public Finance Management Act makes the National Treasury responsible for managing the budget preparation process. To support this, the National Treasury provides an overall fiscal framework based on the macroeconomic forecast. It also proposes the division of revenue between the three spheres of government and provides technical guidelines for budget submissions to ensure that they reflect the priorities set out by the President. These processes are subject to a lengthy period of consultation and modification throughout government, including the Ministers’ Committee on the Budget, before they are considered by Cabinet and ultimately Parliament. The National Treasury recognises that ultimate authority for the nation’s finances rests with Parliament, which debates and votes on the Budget in a range of public forums. The Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act also gives Parliament the opportunity to amend the Budget. The National Treasury conducts a wide range of stakeholder engagements, and encourages all South Africans to comment on the allocation of public funds. The Minister of Finance should, within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House, submit to Parliament a report on all outstanding conditions attached to the bailouts of state-owned entities; while conditions for the 2020/21 Budget allocation to Eskom should be included in the primary legislation, to improve oversight and accountability. Eskom met conditions for the initial transfer of funds in December 2019 and continues to meet conditions for the remaining tranches of the Special Appropriation in 2019/20. Denel, South African Airways, South African Express and the South African Broadcasting Corporation have partially complied with the conditions attached for drawdowns in 2019/20 from the contingency reserve. These entities are being monitored to ensure compliance is achieved by the end of 2019/20. The National Treasury will separately provide a comprehensive analysis of the status of the conditions for all five entities to the committee. All departments that requested virements from compensation of employees to other economic classifications due to unfilled vacancies should, together with the National Treasury, and within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House, provide a report detailing why budgeted vacancies were not filled on time, particularly the critical ones and those on the frontline service delivery points. The National Treasury will investigate the causes of these vacancies with the Department of Public Service and Administration, and provide a detailed report to Parliament within the 60 days. With regards to the R157 million declared unspent allocation for the Jobs Fund by the National Treasury, the committee recommends that the Minister of Finance should, within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House, submit to Parliament a report on the reasons for this underspending and how it will be avoided in future. The National Treasury should also brief the committee on how the Jobs Fund is being administered in order to broaden its understanding. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 The National Treasury has briefed the committee. As outlined in the report, the funds have already been committed to projects and have not been declared unspent. Approved projects are funded through the budget processes, with the Jobs Fund’s allocations being ring- fenced or earmarked. Projects are required to provide budgets over three years even though their expenditure is projected to go beyond the MTEF period. This usually results in benchmarking rather than bottom-up budgeting or rescheduling. External factors affecting projects include the following:",

The National Treasury agrees that all procedural and technical issues need to be dealt with swiftly and effectively and has engaged the Department of Basic Education on these issues. The National Treasury can also confirm that provinces that had their allocations reduced in the 2019 adjustment budget due to technical challenges have received their full allocation in the 2020 Budget. In order to prevent fiscal dumping and fruitless and wasteful expenditure, the Minister of Finance, together with the Ministers of Agriculture, Health and Basic Education and the affected provincial treasuries, should ensure that concrete steps are taken to build and demonstrate capacity to spend, including developing clear plans to monitor expenditure for proposed additional allocations. Further, the ministers need to ensure that the proposed additional allocations are effectively and efficiently spent according to the approved plans before the end of this financial year, and provide a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of the 2020/21 financial year.

The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation and will monitor the spending of all transferred funds and provide the progress report as requested. The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury timeously approves the roll-overs contained in the bill for all projects near completion for the receiving municipalities (for regional bulk infrastructure to be used for emergency Vaal River pollution remediation) and provinces (for medical equipment in Limpopo hospital), and provides a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of 2020/21. The roll-overs have been approved and the funds are available to be spent. The National Treasury will provide the progress report as requested. The committee appeals to the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) to continue to support municipalities until the Eskom and water boards’ debt issues are resolved; and to ensure that the issues around provincial and national departments owing municipalities are also expeditiously addressed to bolster municipal finances. They must further ensure that municipalities create credible credit control measures, debt management policies and effective revenue collection strategies; and provide a progress report in this regard to the committee in the first quarter of 2020/21. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation and continues to work with the Department of Cooperative Governance and SALGA to support municipalities. The revised municipal budgets, described in Chapter 6 of the Budget Review, take account of the need to make payments to Eskom and water boards. The smart meter pilot, also described in Chapter 6, could make revenue collection and payments more sustainable. The National Treasury will provide the progress report as requested. The committee requests that the National Treasury consider allocating a budget for the development of the Moloto Rail Corridor even if it is spread over a period of five years. The argument that a feasibility study found the project to be too expensive was not accepted by the committee, which argued that high cost of a project cannot be elevated above the lives of voters who had been promised a better service. The Minister of Finance agrees that the loss of life on this road, and all roads in the country, is unacceptable. Improving safety on this route is a priority and work is already under way to improve road capacity and safety through infrastructure upgrades. This will be complemented by improving the safety of government-subsidised buses operating along the Moloto Corridor and running road safety campaigns. The option of building a new railway line along the Moloto Corridor was explored in a feasibility study undertaken by the Department of Transport in 2015. The National Treasury’s evaluation of this study concluded that it did not justify investment in a new railway link through the Moloto Corridor route, but",

SANRAL is allocated R4.2 billion to upgrade these roads between 2019/20 and 2022/23. The buses that operate along the Moloto Corridor are subsidised by the Gauteng Provincial Government, including through funds transferred to the province in the public transport operations grant. The grant rules provide for the possibility that the national Department of Transport could take over responsibility for managing the contract for this route. This would allow the national department to issue a new contract for the route to improve the service. The bus operator on this route has recently implemented additional safety measures, including providing advanced driving courses for bus drivers and introducing new buses with cameras and GPS systems. Human settlement and economic development options for this region also need to be considered. A large number of residents in this region commute long distances daily to work in Tshwane – a legacy of apartheid spatial development policies. The National Development Plan calls for reducing the commuting burden and developing in ways that account for the unique needs and potential of different urban and rural areas. Future economic development in the Moloto region could alter commuting patterns, as would the decision by some households to take advantage of new housing opportunities closer to their places of work. All of these options must be kept open. A bus transport system will be much more flexible than a rail-based system to meet future changes in commuting patterns. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport should report progress to Parliament, within three months after the adoption of this report, on what has been done since the pronouncement by President Jacob Zuma – in September 2017 – that the Moloto Rail Development Corridor was a government priority and one of the infrastructure development initiatives. An update is provided in the response to the previous recommendation. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and the conditional grant allocations to provincial and local spheres of government Given the current state of the country’s fiscus presented in the 2019 MTPBS, including proposed budget reductions at provincial and local governments levels, which are at the coalface of service delivery, the committee recommends that the National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, alongside provincial treasuries and provincial cooperative governance departments, ensure that provinces and municipalities use all the available resources in line with the public financial management prescripts in a manner that reduces waste, eradicates opportunities for corruption, and promotes quality service delivery as envisaged in the National Development Plan. The Minister of Finance agrees with this recommendation and appreciates the call to action for all parts of government to redouble their efforts to ensure sound management of public funds. Given the levels of under-investment in infrastructure projects by larger urban municipalities, the committee recommends that the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance fast- track the following initiatives and provide a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of the 2020/21 financial year:",

The effectiveness of the capacity-building system for local government is also being reviewed by the National Treasury, with initial results likely to influence improvements to the system from 2021. While the committee understands the need to restructure certain conditional grants, it is of the view that grant restructuring, termination or merging must not affect service delivery objectives and proper assessment or analysis of grant performance ought to be conducted before any restructuring can happen. These include the following affected conditional grants: the human papillomavirus vaccination grant, which will be merged with the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant; and the fact that from 2021/22, two new components, mental health and oncology, will be added to the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant. The National Treasury agrees that grant restructuring should not harm but improve service delivery. Only small changes are being made to the structure of conditional grants in 2020/21. The Department of Health and the National Treasury will work together to develop a broader strategy that will inform future changes to health grants and ensure their alignment to national health insurance reforms. With regards to the Moloto Corridor, the committee believes that the loss of many lives in that area must come to an end. The committee recommends that the National Treasury consider allocating resources for the development of a Moloto Corridor Rail Project over the 2020/21 MTEF period and make use of all revenue-sourcing avenues at its disposal. The argument that a feasibility study found the project to be too expensive is not acceptable given the high levels of road fatalities there, affecting not only the Department of Transport, but also the Department of Health, due to the overcrowding in the hospital near the high accident zone.

On completion of the pilot project, the committee expects a report identifying lessons learnt during the pilot phase, how resources allocated have been utilised and clear recommendations to improve the programme before it is implemented. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The national Department of Cooperative Governance is coordinating the implementation of the pilots of the district development model. The National Treasury will support the department in identifying lessons learnt for the report requested. The National Treasury should review the vertical division of nationally raised revenue, in order to ascertain whether the 9 per cent allocation to local government is sufficient for the sector to perform its mandate. The Minister of Finance has proposed holding a special local government Budget Forum lekgotla to discuss the structure of the local government fiscal framework, including the size and structure of transfers. The National Treasury should engage more extensively with the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) and respond more comprehensively to its recommendations, as a constitutional body. Government, and specifically the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, should provide detailed implementation plans, including deadlines, for the recommendations that it does agree with. Section 214 of the Constitution requires that the FFC’s recommendations be considered before tabling the division of revenue. Government’s responses to the FFC’s recommendations related to the division of revenue are provided in part 3 of Annexure W1 of the Budget Review. Other FFC recommendations have been referred to the relevant ministers, who will respond directly to the FFC. The Minister of Finance and the Chairperson of the FFC have corresponded to clarify how interactions between the staff of the commission and the National Treasury should be structured to facilitate a productive working relationship. In order to have more effective consultation on budgetary matters, the National Treasury and SALGA should engage more extensively during the budget planning cycle and not only at the Budget Forum meetings. The National Treasury agrees that ongoing engagements with stakeholders, including SALGA, are important to resolving problems in the intergovernmental system. SALGA officials are invited to participate in a range of meetings and processes with the National Treasury and others, such as the local government equitable share working group and conditional grant framework meetings. The National Treasury has proposed collaborating with SALGA and the Department of Cooperative Governance to produce papers and presentations for the local government Budget Forum lekgotla in 2020.",

Provincial departments require a more systematic and sustainable way of addressing rising accruals. The National Treasury, together with the national Department of Health, has developed a Health Action Plan that includes developing accruals intervention strategies and aligning procurement and cash-flow plans. Infrastructure is partly funded through the provincial equitable share, which provinces use at their discretion. The conditional grant framework does not limit redirecting capital allocations to maintenance. Provinces will, however, need to resubmit annual implementation plans showing changes to the infrastructure project list for approval by the national Department of Health. When redirecting funds to maintenance, it is important to consider the stages and cash flows of currently funded projects to ensure there are funds for contractually committed infrastructure projects. The national Department of Health and the National Treasury should provide adequate funding to the Office of the Health Ombud in line with the recently approved structure for better reporting and functionality. The National Treasury will support reprioritisation requests from areas that will not negatively affect service delivery. Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities The Commission for Gender Equality’s funding model should be aligned with the rest of the Chapter 9 institutions, in particular the Public Protector, to enable it to optimally give effect to its mandate. The National Treasury has taken note of this recommendation. The commission’s funding model is similar to that of the Public Protector of South Africa: both are funded through transfer payments in the votes of the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities and the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, respectively. The Commission for Gender Equality should be provided with additional funds in order to retain existing staff and attract new staff. Specific emphasis should be placed on the funding of staff for legal clinics, public education and information, communication and legal support. To this end, provinces with the largest case load should be prioritised where offices require additional support. Departments, public entities and constitutional institutions are encouraged to reprioritise existing funds for emerging priorities. The National Treasury will continue to engage the Commission for Gender Equality as part of the budget process, specifically in relation to the issues highlighted by the committee. Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Agriculture has been highlighted by the President in his economic stimulus package, including the National Treasury’s discussion paper entitled “Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth, and Competitiveness: Towards an Economic Strategy for South Africa”, as one of the sectors with massive job creation potential. However, the sector is constrained by challenges which include climate change in the form of frequent and prolonged droughts, floods and veld fires; disease outbreaks; technological advances; and international trade standards and regulations. To give effect to the department’s mandate and some of the proposals in the Treasury discussion document, including the plans to reprioritise funding towards investments in agriculture, a significant increase in the budget allocation to the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development for the medium term is proposed. The National Treasury agrees with the committee’s recommendation. Over the 2020 MTEF period, an allocation of R495.1 million has been reprioritised within the existing budget baseline to boost agriculture production; improve health and food safety programmes; develop capacity to respond to biosecurity ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 105 threats; revitalise laboratories; revitalise quarantine stations and strengthen inspection services at ports of entry; and strengthen animal and plant health, inspection and laboratory services. Over the medium term, a further R500 million will be allocated to the sector to fast-track the process of restoring land rights, supporting inclusive economic transformation as envisaged in the National Treasury’s discussion paper.

The funds will be used to establish a vaccine reserve to ensure that vaccines are available in sufficient quantities to address animal disease outbreaks (e.g. Anthrax, African Horse Sickness, Rift Valley Fever, Brucellosis, etc.), and to manufacture public good vaccines (orphan vaccines), which are unprofitable for OBP to produce but are of national importance in animal disease prevention and management. While the modernisation project is in progress, the aging infrastructure that does not meet good manufacturing practice standards is limiting OBP’s production efficiency and competitiveness. The National Treasury agrees with the committee’s recommendation. Over the medium term, the reprioritised allocation of R495.1 million to the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development for the Agricultural Production, Health, Food Safety, Natural Resources and Disaster Management Programme will indirectly reduce OBP’s burden of producing and distributing vaccines. The budget allocated to the department includes a component for preventing and managing animal and livestock disease. There is little scope for additional allocations. The department will have to collaborate with OBP to prevent and manage livestock diseases. The National Treasury will continue to engage with the department and OBP to ensure that funding is available. Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy The National Treasury should restore MTEF funding of the Council for Geoscience in the short term, while securing R300 million baseline funding for the medium to long term in order to ensure that the entity is able to meet its mandate, which is long term in nature and scope, including the funding model that accommodates the National Key Point designation of the entity, in order to ensure compliance. The National Treasury agrees with the committee’s recommendation. Over the 2020 MTEF period, an additional allocation of R345.8 million has been reprioritised within the existing budget baselines for geological mapping to assess on-shore and off-shore mineral, agricultural, energy and groundwater resources to catalyse their exploration.

The National Treasury and the Department of Tourism will hold further discussions to realign budget and spending priorities over the medium term. The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance, notwithstanding the constrained national fiscus, consider the contribution of the tourism sector to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country and the labour-intensive nature of the tourism sector and find innovative ways of increasing the budget appropriated for the Tourism vote. The National Treasury recognises tourism’s important contribution to GDP growth, but there is little scope to provide additional funding at this time. The National Treasury discussion paper, Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth, and Competitiveness: Towards an Economic Strategy for South Africa, identifies the tourism sector as one of the labour-intensive sectors that could create jobs for semi-skilled and unskilled workers in the short to long term. The National Treasury supports the implementation of microeconomic reforms in the paper that could stimulate growth, investment and job creation in tourism. Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans The committee recommends that the National Treasury should not lower the Department of Defence’s baseline budget allocation in nominal terms over the MTEF period. This relates to all outlying years of the MTEF and specifically to 2021/22 where the budget is set to decrease from R52.5 billion in 2020/21 to R50.9 billion in 2021/22. The Department of Defence has an allocation of R52.4 billion in 2020/21, R50.8 billion in 2021/22 and R53 billion in 2022/23. In nominal terms, the 2020 MTEF allocations of the department are comparable to the 2019 MTEF allocations. The committee urges the National Treasury to provide additional funds specifically for the purpose of border safeguarding. The committee recommends that the number of sub-units be increased incrementally over the MTEF period with the aim of having 22 sub-units deployed for landward borderline duties by the end of the MTEF period. Additional funds should also include an allocation for the use of technology as a force multiplier for border safeguarding purposes. Border security remains a priority for government. The National Treasury has allocated an additional R225 million to the Department of Defence over the medium term to procure equipment and technology to support military units deployed to safeguard our borders. The committee urges immediate engagement between the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Finance and the Commander in Chief of the South African National Defence Force, to finalise a funding plan that will arrest the current decline of the military. This recommendation is derived from the dire financial and resource situation shared with the committee by especially the South African Army, the South African Air Force and the South African Navy during its recent oversight engagements. The finalised plan should be presented to the committee no later than the end of the first quarter of 2020/21. The National Treasury agrees that the funding challenges of the Department of Defence should be discussed. The department is arranging a meeting with the President, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Public Service and Administration, and the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans to address the funding challenges. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 107 The committee noted comments by the Department of Defence that savings to compensation of employees can be made through a process of force rejuvenation. The committee therefore recommends a joint approach to force rejuvenation that would see the Department of Defence develop and roll out a rejuvenation plan and the National Treasury provide funding for an exit mechanism to speed up rejuvenation. The National Treasury should, as soon as possible, release funds to facilitate an interim exit mechanism for the remainder of 2019/20. The Department of Defence should finalise rejuvenation plans for full implementation from 2020/21. The National Treasury agrees that the Department of Defence should develop a rejuvenation strategy. At a ministerial meeting, it was resolved that the department would develop and submit a rejuvenation strategy to the National Treasury by May 2019. The department has not yet submitted the strategy, but is engaging with the National Treasury on a draft. The Department of Defence has yet to implement early retirement without penalties, which was introduced in the 2019 Budget Review as one of the measures to reduce spending on compensation of employees. Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services In addition to recommending that zero budget reductions be applied in the case of the South African Human Rights Commission and the Public Protector of South Africa, the committee recommends that additional funding be provided to:",

    "recommendation": "that make it difficult to accurately forecast GDP growth figures but recommends that the National Treasury draw in more independent expertise in its forecasting process to improve the credibility of the fiscal framework and better manage the economic and fiscal risks associated with its forecasts. The National Treasury uses various models to generate economic forecasts, including inflation, terms of trade, sector and business cycle models. They supplement the main macroeconomic forecast model, which is a large semi-structural econometric model similar to those used by the Reserve Bank and the Bureau for Economic Research. The assumptions that are used in the main model are sourced from global institutions or determined internally through a rigorous assumptions process. The model is regularly updated to capture changes in the South African and global economy. The Economic Policy division is engaging with the Bureau for Economic Research to assess and improve the model. Other models that are used for policy analysis and research are also maintained and updated. These are less appropriate for forecasting, but are still used to analyse trade-offs of policy and other shocks to the economy to better inform the forecast process. Since 2014, forecast errors from the National Treasury and market analysts have been decreasing. Independent studies show that National Treasury forecasts are on par with, or better than, market projections. It should also be noted that no institution has had consistently accurate forecasts over time.1 The Minister of Finance agreed that high debt now will burden future generations if it is not managed properly and the situation is unsustainable. We therefore require the National Treasury to report quarterly on the effectiveness of its debt management strategies, that would ensure that the level of debt stabilises over the medium term as the current situation is not sustainable. Rising fiscal deficits over the past decade have increased government’s borrowing requirements and debt-to-GDP ratio. Accordingly, the only way to lower the debt-to-GDP ratio is through consistently higher economic growth or lower spending. Government’s prudent debt management strategy enables it to manage the risks associated with elevated borrowing. Debt management is guided by strategic risk benchmarks for refinancing, interest, inflation and currency risks.",

    "recommendation": "• Take disciplinary steps against officials who make or permit irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure. In 2018, the National Treasury issued an irregular expenditure framework as an instruction, which was revised in May 2019. It sets out procedures for disciplining officials accused of financial misconduct and, where applicable, recovering funds and laying criminal charges. These disciplinary steps are required before such expenditure may be condoned. Amendments to the Public Audit Act (2004), which took effect on 1 April 2019, empower the Auditor- General to refer any suspected material irregularities for investigation. They also empower the Auditor- General to take appropriate remedial action and to issue a certificate of debt where an accounting officer or accounting authority has failed to comply with remedial action. The South African Revenue Service (SARS) needs to develop its policies and capacity to tax the digital economy more effectively and is required to report on this to the committee at the first quarterly briefing of 2020. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation and will report as requested. Officials from both the National Treasury and SARS have been engaging with other countries to find global consensus on how to ensure that profit from digitised business models is taxed appropriately. The aim of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development committee responsible for making recommendations in this area is to reach consensus on a new international tax architecture in 2020. South Africa is represented on the committee. SARS needs to work together with the relevant stakeholders to address the root causes of fiscal leakages emanating from, but not limited to, Road Accident Fund claims, medico legal claims and police litigations, particularly those resulting mainly from negligence. SARS will continue to engage with stakeholders on limiting the fiscal leakages cited by the committee. For example, SARS participates in an inter-agency working group with the Department of Trade and Industry and the National Treasury that focuses on tackling illicit trade, particularly in the clothing and textile industry. The committee notes with concern the direct impacts of incorrect economic growth forecasts on tax revenue collection by SARS. We are concerned that the revenue shortfall increases from a projected R14.5 billion in 2018/19 to R52.5 billion in 2019/20 and R84 billion in 2020/21 and that the scope for further tax increases has also narrowed. The National Treasury should support SARS more actively, ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 111 including financially and in rebuilding the organisation without interfering in its operational matters. SARS, the National Treasury and law enforcement agencies need to work far more effectively in processing cases against any staff members legitimately accused of financial misconduct and corruption. The final revenue shortfall for 2018/19 was R57.3 billion compared to 2018 Budget estimates, and based on the audited revenue outcomes for 2018/19. The significant downward revisions to the economic and revenue outlook since the 2019 Budget are mainly the result of weaker economic performance. Tax revenue collection estimates published in the Budget Review and MTBPS are projections, rather than targets. If assumptions are not realised or economic performance is different than projected, these revenue estimates are subsequently revised. In the 2019 MTBPS, the National Treasury proposed additional allocations of R1 billion over three years for SARS to rebuild capacity, improve operations, and implement critical projects and recommendations from the Nugent Commission. Investigations into financial misconduct and corruption are ongoing. The National Treasury and SARS presented a progress report to the Standing Committee on Finance about implementing the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by SARS. The committee is concerned about a constantly increasing gross debt-to-GDP ratio, a projected increase from R3.2 trillion in 2019/20 reaching R4.5 trillion in 2022/23 (71 per cent by 2023) as this is likely to burden future generations if concerted efforts are not made to sustainably reduce it.

    "recommendation": "2009 recession, is a cause for concern, since there does not appear to be a point of stabilisation over the medium term. The committee also notes that debt service costs have become the fastest-growing expenditure item, costing the national fiscus R203.7 billion per annum (13.7 per cent) in 2019/20 and are expected to reach almost R300 billion in 2022/23. These funds could be utilised for other competing economic and social needs. The committee recommends that the National Treasury do far more to incrementally reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio and report on progress on this at its quarterly briefings. In the 2019 MTBPS, government proposed achieving a main budget primary balance by 2022/23. Achieving the fiscal target requires making large additional adjustments to the fiscal framework exceeding R150 billion in total over the medium term. These adjustments would need to address growth in the public-service wage bill and include a sustainable plan for state-owned companies in order to reduce future transfers. Given the size of the required adjustment, additional tax measures were considered. These measures require making difficult decisions that will affect the economy and the distribution of public resources. The committee notes that the 2019 MTBPS budgeted contingency reserves amount to R18 billion over the medium term, or R6 billion each year. These amounts are not adequate and are likely to leave South Africa susceptible to external and internal shocks in an event of unforeseen circumstances such as imminent dangers of food insecurity and water scarcity, including through potential floods and drought. The committee urges the National Treasury to quantify and factor in these potential risks in the economic growth forecasts and the overall fiscal framework. The National Treasury assesses fiscal risks to identify and plan for unexpected and uncertain events. This process informs the formulation of the fiscal framework and culminates in the publication of an annual fiscal risk statement. The contingency reserve is part of the expenditure ceiling and is determined within this overall limit. Its size depends on available resources and the level of uncertainty and is revised during the budget process. Analysis in the 2013 Budget Review showed that unforeseen and unavoidable expenditure adjustments, for which the contingency reserve was budgeted, averaged R4 billion per year over five years. This was much lower than the contingency reserve amounts, which were then lowered. In addition to the contingency reserve, there are disaster relief grants for local and provincial government. In the past, the combination of the contingency reserve, the disaster relief grants and other",

    "recommendation": "2020 BUDGET REVIEW 112 ring-fenced funds within infrastructure grants has proven sufficient to meet the costs associated with natural disasters. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Adjustments Appropriation Bill The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury carefully scrutinises government departments’ ability to spend allocated funds before submitting budget proposals to Parliament in order to prevent continued underspending on allocated funds as it has implications for government debt and the interest payments. Over the past 25 years the National Treasury has developed a rigorous budget process that imposes the highest level of scrutiny to ensure that departments have the ability to spend allocated funds. The Constitution mandates the National Treasury to manage public finances, and the Public Finance Management Act makes the National Treasury responsible for managing the budget preparation process. To support this, the National Treasury provides an overall fiscal framework based on the macroeconomic forecast. It also proposes the division of revenue between the three spheres of government and provides technical guidelines for budget submissions to ensure that they reflect the priorities set out by the President. These processes are subject to a lengthy period of consultation and modification throughout government, including the Ministers’ Committee on the Budget, before they are considered by Cabinet and ultimately Parliament. The National Treasury recognises that ultimate authority for the nation’s finances rests with Parliament, which debates and votes on the Budget in a range of public forums. The Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act also gives Parliament the opportunity to amend the Budget. The National Treasury conducts a wide range of stakeholder engagements, and encourages all South Africans to comment on the allocation of public funds. The Minister of Finance should, within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House, submit to Parliament a report on all outstanding conditions attached to the bailouts of state-owned entities; while conditions for the 2020/21 Budget allocation to Eskom should be included in the primary legislation, to improve oversight and accountability. Eskom met conditions for the initial transfer of funds in December 2019 and continues to meet conditions for the remaining tranches of the Special Appropriation in 2019/20. Denel, South African Airways, South African Express and the South African Broadcasting Corporation have partially complied with the conditions attached for drawdowns in 2019/20 from the contingency reserve. These entities are being monitored to ensure compliance is achieved by the end of 2019/20. The National Treasury will separately provide a comprehensive analysis of the status of the conditions for all five entities to the committee. All departments that requested virements from compensation of employees to other economic classifications due to unfilled vacancies should, together with the National Treasury, and within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House, provide a report detailing why budgeted vacancies were not filled on time, particularly the critical ones and those on the frontline service delivery points. The National Treasury will investigate the causes of these vacancies with the Department of Public Service and Administration, and provide a detailed report to Parliament within the 60 days. With regards to the R157 million declared unspent allocation for the Jobs Fund by the National Treasury, the committee recommends that the Minister of Finance should, within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House, submit to Parliament a report on the reasons for this underspending and how it will be avoided in future. The National Treasury should also brief the committee on how the Jobs Fund is being administered in order to broaden its understanding. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 The National Treasury has briefed the committee. As outlined in the report, the funds have already been committed to projects and have not been declared unspent. Approved projects are funded through the budget processes, with the Jobs Fund’s allocations being ring- fenced or earmarked. Projects are required to provide budgets over three years even though their expenditure is projected to go beyond the MTEF period.

The National Treasury agrees that all procedural and technical issues need to be dealt with swiftly and effectively and has engaged the Department of Basic Education on these issues. The National Treasury can also confirm that provinces that had their allocations reduced in the 2019 adjustment budget due to technical challenges have received their full allocation in the 2020 Budget. In order to prevent fiscal dumping and fruitless and wasteful expenditure, the Minister of Finance, together with the Ministers of Agriculture, Health and Basic Education and the affected provincial treasuries, should ensure that concrete steps are taken to build and demonstrate capacity to spend, including developing clear plans to monitor expenditure for proposed additional allocations. Further, the ministers need to ensure that the proposed additional allocations are effectively and efficiently spent according to the approved plans before the end of this financial year, and provide a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of the 2020/21 financial year.

The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation and will monitor the spending of all transferred funds and provide the progress report as requested. The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury timeously approves the roll-overs contained in the bill for all projects near completion for the receiving municipalities (for regional bulk infrastructure to be used for emergency Vaal River pollution remediation) and provinces (for medical equipment in Limpopo hospital), and provides a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of 2020/21. The roll-overs have been approved and the funds are available to be spent. The National Treasury will provide the progress report as requested. The committee appeals to the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) to continue to support municipalities until the Eskom and water boards’ debt issues are resolved; and to ensure that the issues around provincial and national departments owing municipalities are also expeditiously addressed to bolster municipal finances. They must further ensure that municipalities create credible credit control measures, debt management policies and effective revenue collection strategies; and provide a progress report in this regard to the committee in the first quarter of 2020/21. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation and continues to work with the Department of Cooperative Governance and SALGA to support municipalities. The revised municipal budgets, described in Chapter 6 of the Budget Review, take account of the need to make payments to Eskom and water boards. The smart meter pilot, also described in Chapter 6, could make revenue collection and payments more sustainable. The National Treasury will provide the progress report as requested. The committee requests that the National Treasury consider allocating a budget for the development of the Moloto Rail Corridor even if it is spread over a period of five years. The argument that a feasibility study found the project to be too expensive was not accepted by the committee, which argued that high cost of a project cannot be elevated above the lives of voters who had been promised a better service. The Minister of Finance agrees that the loss of life on this road, and all roads in the country, is unacceptable. Improving safety on this route is a priority and work is already under way to improve road capacity and safety through infrastructure upgrades. This will be complemented by improving the safety of government-subsidised buses operating along the Moloto Corridor and running road safety campaigns. The option of building a new railway line along the Moloto Corridor was explored in a feasibility study undertaken by the Department of Transport in 2015. The National Treasury’s evaluation of this study concluded that it did not justify investment in a new railway link through the Moloto Corridor route, but",

SANRAL is allocated R4.2 billion to upgrade these roads between 2019/20 and 2022/23. The buses that operate along the Moloto Corridor are subsidised by the Gauteng Provincial Government, including through funds transferred to the province in the public transport operations grant. The grant rules provide for the possibility that the national Department of Transport could take over responsibility for managing the contract for this route. This would allow the national department to issue a new contract for the route to improve the service. The bus operator on this route has recently implemented additional safety measures, including providing advanced driving courses for bus drivers and introducing new buses with cameras and GPS systems. Human settlement and economic development options for this region also need to be considered. A large number of residents in this region commute long distances daily to work in Tshwane – a legacy of apartheid spatial development policies. The National Development Plan calls for reducing the commuting burden and developing in ways that account for the unique needs and potential of different urban and rural areas. Future economic development in the Moloto region could alter commuting patterns, as would the decision by some households to take advantage of new housing opportunities closer to their places of work. All of these options must be kept open. A bus transport system will be much more flexible than a rail-based system to meet future changes in commuting patterns. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport should report progress to Parliament, within three months after the adoption of this report, on what has been done since the pronouncement by President Jacob Zuma – in September 2017 – that the Moloto Rail Development Corridor was a government priority and one of the infrastructure development initiatives. An update is provided in the response to the previous recommendation. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and the conditional grant allocations to provincial and local spheres of government Given the current state of the country’s fiscus presented in the 2019 MTPBS, including proposed budget reductions at provincial and local governments levels, which are at the coalface of service delivery, the committee recommends that the National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, alongside provincial treasuries and provincial cooperative governance departments, ensure that provinces and municipalities use all the available resources in line with the public financial management prescripts in a manner that reduces waste, eradicates opportunities for corruption, and promotes quality service delivery as envisaged in the National Development Plan. The Minister of Finance agrees with this recommendation and appreciates the call to action for all parts of government to redouble their efforts to ensure sound management of public funds. Given the levels of under-investment in infrastructure projects by larger urban municipalities, the committee recommends that the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance fast- track the following initiatives and provide a progress report to the committee in the first quarter of the 2020/21 financial year:",

The effectiveness of the capacity-building system for local government is also being reviewed by the National Treasury, with initial results likely to influence improvements to the system from 2021. While the committee understands the need to restructure certain conditional grants, it is of the view that grant restructuring, termination or merging must not affect service delivery objectives and proper assessment or analysis of grant performance ought to be conducted before any restructuring can happen. These include the following affected conditional grants: the human papillomavirus vaccination grant, which will be merged with the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant; and the fact that from 2021/22, two new components, mental health and oncology, will be added to the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant. The National Treasury agrees that grant restructuring should not harm but improve service delivery. Only small changes are being made to the structure of conditional grants in 2020/21. The Department of Health and the National Treasury will work together to develop a broader strategy that will inform future changes to health grants and ensure their alignment to national health insurance reforms. With regards to the Moloto Corridor, the committee believes that the loss of many lives in that area must come to an end. The committee recommends that the National Treasury consider allocating resources for the development of a Moloto Corridor Rail Project over the 2020/21 MTEF period and make use of all revenue-sourcing avenues at its disposal. The argument that a feasibility study found the project to be too expensive is not acceptable given the high levels of road fatalities there, affecting not only the Department of Transport, but also the Department of Health, due to the overcrowding in the hospital near the high accident zone.

The National Treasury will provide further reports to the committee as requested. The committee recommends that the National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and affected treasuries, expedite the pilot project of the district models, which will be implemented in Oliver Reginald Tambo District Municipality and eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, and ensure that resources allocated to this project are effectively and efficiently utilised and value for money is achieved. On completion of the pilot project, the committee expects a report identifying lessons learnt during the pilot phase, how resources allocated have been utilised and clear recommendations to improve the programme before it is implemented. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The national Department of Cooperative Governance is coordinating the implementation of the pilots of the district development model. The National Treasury will support the department in identifying lessons learnt for the report requested. The National Treasury should review the vertical division of nationally raised revenue, in order to ascertain whether the 9 per cent allocation to local government is sufficient for the sector to perform its mandate. The Minister of Finance has proposed holding a special local government Budget Forum lekgotla to discuss the structure of the local government fiscal framework, including the size and structure of transfers. The National Treasury should engage more extensively with the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) and respond more comprehensively to its recommendations, as a constitutional body. Government, and specifically the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, should provide detailed implementation plans, including deadlines, for the recommendations that it does agree with. Section 214 of the Constitution requires that the FFC’s recommendations be considered before tabling the division of revenue. Government’s responses to the FFC’s recommendations related to the division of revenue are provided in part 3 of Annexure W1 of the Budget Review. Other FFC recommendations have been referred to the relevant ministers, who will respond directly to the FFC. The Minister of Finance and the Chairperson of the FFC have corresponded to clarify how interactions between the staff of the commission and the National Treasury should be structured to facilitate a productive working relationship. In order to have more effective consultation on budgetary matters, the National Treasury and SALGA should engage more extensively during the budget planning cycle and not only at the Budget Forum meetings. The National Treasury agrees that ongoing engagements with stakeholders, including SALGA, are important to resolving problems in the intergovernmental system. SALGA officials are invited to participate in a range of meetings and processes with the National Treasury and others, such as the local government equitable share working group and conditional grant framework meetings. The National Treasury has proposed collaborating with SALGA and the Department of Cooperative Governance to produce papers and presentations for the local government Budget Forum lekgotla in 2020.",

This will allow the committee to consider all the information before it and report to the National Assembly in terms of section 4(4)(a) of the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act, No 9 of 2009. The National Treasury admits in the 2020 MTBPS that these unpaid invoices present a serious risk to government finances, therefore the committee cannot allow this situation to escalate to the levels where Eskom finds itself in regarding the municipal debt. The committee is also of the view that if this problem is not addressed, it has a potential to compromise the credibility of government budget. The National Treasury will provide the information as captured by national and provincial departments in the annual financial statements that are submitted to the Auditor‐General. The Minister of Finance ensures that the National Treasury provides the committee with the set of conditions that must be met for the provisional funding to be made available in 2021/22 to build the Tygerberg Regional Hospital and Klipfontein Hospital in the Western Cape. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation and will provide the information directly to the committee. Report of the Standing and Select Committees on Finance on the 2020 Revised Fiscal Framework The special adjustments budget does not provide enough clarity on infrastructure development projects – and this is utterly crucial to our economic recovery. The National Treasury needs to report on this at its next quarterly briefing. The Appropriations Committee also needs to consider taking this forward. A detailed pipeline of bankable projects is shared in the 2020 Budget Review. The National Treasury has been working with the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) and the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure to operationalise the Infrastructure Fund. A briefing should ideally be provided by all three parties, and in this regard, an opportunity to brief the committee will be welcome. We recommend that the Minister of Finance reports quarterly on the effectiveness of the National Treasury’s debt management strategies that would ensure that the level of debt stabilises over the medium term and avoids a sovereign debt crisis. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and will provide quarterly reports. It publishes a public debt management report every year. The Minister of Finance should brief the committee on progress made with the development of the State Bank. The National Treasury will endeavour to brief the committee. There are currently several state banks in existence, often with overlapping mandates. The key challenge is to rationalise and consolidate these banks, and ensure they are able to generate sufficient revenue to fund their operations without relying on government funding.

The National Treasury should provide the committee with more detail regarding how the money will be spent, in which sectors, and what type of jobs will be created. The Presidency oversees the programme and reports are consolidated therein. Departments will also submit spending and performance information in line with requirements of the National Treasury regulations. The committee requires the National Treasury to brief it on why “zero‐based budgeting” is being proposed, how will it be implemented and what its implications are. The National Treasury welcomes the opportunity to brief the committee at its earliest convenience. Since June 2020, the National Treasury has been reviewing government spending to improve efficiency. More than 30 spending reviews across all functions have been conducted to understand service‐ delivery outcomes and how these might change under different scenarios. These reviews will be used to inform the development of zero‐based budgeting. Report of the Standing and Select Committees on Finance on the 2020 second Revised Fiscal Framework While the committee notes that the assigning of the high‐demand digital spectrum and reducing the cost of broadband and other costs of doing business forms part of the measures of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, it is still concerned at the slow pace of the auctioning of the digital spectrum and persistent high costs of broadband to consumers. The committee reiterates that the National Treasury needs to engage with the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services on this. Given the desperate need for revenue, the committee urges government to accelerate the auctioning of the digital spectrum. The National Treasury agrees with the committee and engagements are ongoing. In the 2020 MTBPS, government allocated an additional R84.7 million to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa in 2020/21 for the licensing of high‐demand spectrum. The amount of revenue collected will depend on the design of the auction process and how mobile operators respond. The committee reiterates its disappointment that there has only been 8 per cent take up of the loan guarantee scheme of R200 billion. The committee requires the National Treasury to report to it on its renegotiation of the lending criteria with the participating commercial banks. The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance considers the expansion of this loan guarantee scheme to directly include development financial institutions being able to provide liquidity to projects that they are directly funding. The National Treasury welcomes the opportunity to brief the committee at its earliest convenience. The committee reiterates its view expressed in its special adjustment budget report that: “Government should engage with all stakeholders, including the private sector on how to unlock domestic investment through impact investments and Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act [1956]. NT needs to consider creating the necessary regulatory mechanisms to ensure increased pension fund investments directly into infrastructure projects including real estate, which can unlock capital that currently is not finding its way into projects. The majority in the Committee believes there should be more engagement on the feasibility of prescribing assets for pension funds and will request a presentation by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and NT on this when the FSCA releases the policy paper as announced by the Minister of Finance in his post‐adjustment budget briefing to the Committee. National Treasury should ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 also consider how pension fund members can leverage their retirement fund assets to improve their personal financial circumstances...” Alongside the 2020 MTBPS, the National Treasury released an explanatory note on financial sector updates including the review of Regulation 28 – to allow retirement funds to invest more in infrastructure – and, under certain conditions, early access to retirement savings. Annexure F provides an update on these matters. The committee requires the National Treasury (and SARS) to update it in the 2021 Budget Review on the developments in resolving the impasse on the taxing rights of countries when it comes to income derived from digital activities. The committee is aware that South Africa is one of the few countries that are already collecting VAT from the digital economy and commends this. The committee recommends that while the National Treasury participates in the Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD), it should work in collaboration with the African Tax Administration Forum on the digital tax framework. The National Treasury welcomes the opportunity to brief the committee at its earliest convenience. As a member of the Steering Group of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, the African Tax Administration Forum and G24, South Africa is actively involved in finding a consensus‐ based solution on addressing the income tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Adjustments Appropriation Bill That the Minister of Finance ensures that the National Treasury provides a comprehensive report on how it plans to fund infrastructure spending aimed at reconstruction, rehabilitating and maintaining social and economic infrastructure such as schools, roads and other government infrastructure assets post COVID‐19. The committee is concerned that a lack of a detailed and proper infrastructure recovery plan will lead government to the same path it is currently experiencing with Eskom infrastructure maintenance‐related challenges. This plan should signal the National Treasury’s commitment on funding public infrastructure for reconstruction, maintenance and rehabilitation, while also outlining potential future costs escalations due to delays in funding these key government infrastructure activities and estimated costs overruns of delayed infrastructure projects. This report should be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. Government has radically restructured its infrastructure delivery model. A new institution, Infrastructure South Africa, has been established by Cabinet to oversee and coordinate public infrastructure delivery. In February 2020, the Minister of Finance announced that government is expected to spend R815 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. Of this, spending on economic infrastructure, mainly by state‐owned companies, accounted for 75.1 per cent, while spending on social infrastructure accounted for 20.9 per cent of the total. The Infrastructure Fund is a key element of the economic recovery plan. It aims to diversify government funding sources available for infrastructure by combining capital from the public and private sectors, development finance institutions and multilateral development banks. It will harness skills and capacity from the private sector to improve the quality of planning, enhance the speed and quality of spending, and reduce the cost of infrastructure. This in turn will contribute to the growth of the economy and to increased productivity and employment creation. In line with the pronouncements made by the President on infrastructure investments for both economic growth stimulation and job creation, the Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury provides a comprehensive report on how this bill responds to the pronouncements made by the",

The National Treasury can submit a report in this regard. Government has allocated a total of R625 million to the DBSA, the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission and the Government Technical Advisory Centre to help government institutions plan and package infrastructure projects for submission to the National Treasury for funding. Projects that are viable and shown to grow the economy, create jobs and crowd in private investment will be allocated funding through the R100 billion that has been set aside for blended infrastructure projects through the Infrastructure Fund. The Minister of Finance should ensure that stringent measures are put in place to ensure that procurement processes are transparent and credible, including the attainment of value for money. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and will provide Parliament with a detailed report on these measures at its earliest convenience.

    "recommendation": "2020 Division of Revenue Act, the adjustments of certain grant frameworks proposed to the committee, to expedite the release of the much‐needed funds for expenditure to strengthen the implementation of the lockdown regulations and rapid response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, should be included. This will be in addition to the provisions which have already been activated to respond to the pandemic in terms of the 2019 Division of Revenue Act. The National Treasury supports the recommendation. These additional conditions will enable the funds to be used to respond to COVID‐19 rapidly rather than waiting for their inclusion in the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill. The updated frameworks were gazetted on 3 July 2020. While the committee welcomes the expansion of access to early childhood development services, which will reach almost 700 000 children under the age of four years in 2022/23, and the additional R1.4 billion for the early childhood development grant to increase the subsidy per child from R15 per day to R17 per day in 2020/21, increasing to R18.57 per day by 2022/23, the committee is of the view that this is a crucial conditional grant for early childhood development and therefore recommends that the Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Social Development and provincial treasuries, ensure that proper mechanisms are developed and put in place to comply with the grant framework, improve the grant expenditure and grant performance, given the 2019/20 grant performance picture demonstrated by some provinces. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. The Department of Social Development is responsible for administering this grant and ensuring that its conditions are met. The National Treasury will continue to work with the department and provincial treasuries to oversee grant spending. This recommendation is also referred to the Minister of Social Development and provincial treasuries. Due to the importance of education in our country which aims to empower citizens to fight unemployment, inequalities and poverty as well as the need to address education infrastructure backlogs in certain areas, especially in schools where the state of infrastructure poses a danger to pupils, the National Treasury should review the baseline reduction of the education infrastructure grant and the school infrastructure backlogs grant for the MTEF period and, furthermore, the national electrification programme grants should also be considered based on their evidence and merits. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considered past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant real growth in allocations in recent years. It is anticipated that, although these reductions might delay",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 116 the start of new infrastructure projects this year, provinces and municipalities will be able to implement existing projects with the remaining allocation. Both the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance, together with provincial treasuries and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA), should intensify efforts to support local government interventions to improve revenue collection, such as the pilot project to retrofit smart meters, and report the progress to Parliament in the next budget cycle; as this requires sector committees also to play their oversight role. Furthermore, sound debt recovery strategies and mechanisms are required to improve revenue collection. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. Managing municipal revenue is a shared responsibility. Government is strengthening national coordination through the single and integrated revenue management framework, which improves collaboration between the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance as they enter a municipality. The framework will assist with planning and budgeting, programme design and implementation. The National Treasury has also placed revenue advisors at each provincial treasury. These advisors will help capacitate the provincial treasuries on revenue initiatives for municipalities and assist municipalities to address inefficiencies in revenue management. In addition, a Multidisciplinary Revenue Committee has been established to strengthen collaboration and address fragmentation on revenue issues. The committee includes the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance, the Department of Public Enterprises, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure, the Department of Water and Sanitation, Eskom, SALGA and the National Energy Regulator of South Africa. The committee will focus on four recommendations that Cabinet approved in 2018: a national campaign to pay for services, the introduction of smart meters for electricity and water, the restructuring of arrear debt for Eskom and water services, and the development of a process to deal with defaulting municipalities. In addition, it will proactively address shortfalls within municipal revenues. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance, provincial treasuries and SALGA, should ensure that municipalities develop and provide proper plans and mechanisms in line with the COVID‐19 interventions for the additional R20 billion allocation proposed by government for municipalities, to avoid wasteful and fruitless expenditure, and such mechanisms should ensure that consequence management prevails wherever there is corruption and mismanagement of funds. The committee believes that this will go a long way in addressing issues such as additional responsibilities posed by COVID‐19 regulations, unemployment, irrecoverable debts and budget shortfalls. The National Treasury agrees that municipalities should avoid wasteful and fruitless expenditure. The COVID‐19 pandemic required flexibility to adapt to rapidly evolving circumstances. Of the R20 billion provided for municipalities, R11 billion was added through the local government equitable share to allow municipalities discretion to respond to local conditions. The remaining funds were provided through existing conditional grants with specific conditions. Additional conditions were added to some grants to allow for spending in response to COVID‐19. With regard to the suspension of the public transport network grant for Buffalo City metropolitan municipality, Mbombela and Msunduzi local municipalities, and given the fact that this is a much needed programme to improve public transport networks, address commuter inequalities and reduce road fatalities; the Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the Minister of Transport, relevant provincial treasuries and SALGA should take drastic measures to ensure that adequate support and capacity development interventions are tailored to resolve the matter speedily and ensure that, once restored, the conditional grant achieves its intended outcomes. The committee will continue to monitor progress in this regard. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation and will continue supporting the cities to realise the objectives of the grant. With regard to the baseline reduction of the provincial roads maintenance grant, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport should thoroughly assess and consider the service delivery implications, given the poor status of road maintenance in some provinces and the level of road carnage which ultimately cost the state a lot of money, before the baseline reduction of R2.8 billion over the medium term is effected. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considers past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant real growth in allocations in recent years. This grant is intended to supplement transfers from the provincial equitable share to fund the maintenance and upgrading of provincial roads. Provinces are expected to fund the construction of new roads from their own budgets. The Department of Transport should expedite the finalisation of the transport subsidy policy which will include improving public transport for rural commuters and address inequalities. On the other hand, the National Treasury should support government efforts to intensify rural development intervention programmes to ensure that public service centres are geared towards local people, particularly townships and poor rural communities. The sector committees should monitor progress on the policy development front, while the Select Committee on Appropriations will monitor budget implementation once such a policy is concluded. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Transport. The committee notes the views suggesting that the local equitable share of 9 per cent of the nationally raised revenue is not cost‐reflective and, therefore, not adequate to fund local government functions. The committee is of the view that SALGA, together with the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), should work together to consider scientific evidence available to help review the local government equitable share formula in a fair and equitable manner. The committee will continue to monitor progress in this regard. This recommendation is in effect. The National Treasury, together with the other specified departments and entities, is part of a standing technical committee that regularly discusses issues relating to the local government equitable share. In 2013/14, a new equitable share formula was introduced based on work by committee members. This formula is updated annually through the committee. While the committee understands the need for budget reprioritisation over the 2020 MTEF, due to the current economic outlook, the committee is of the firm view that these budget cuts should not compromise provincial and local government frontline service delivery points, especially where more human capital is required, and personnel at lower levels should continue to be protected. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. It is important that service delivery implications are considered alongside the need to balance the fiscal framework. Reductions to provincial and local government conditional grants were necessary to meet urgent spending needs related to the COVID‐19 pandemic. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considers past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant real growth in allocations in recent years. Given the underexpenditure and underperformance of certain conditional grants such as the human papillomavirus grant; the maths, science and technology grant; the learners with profound intellectual disabilities grant; the title deeds restoration grant; and the comprehensive agricultural support programme grant; as reported during the in‐year monitoring for 2019/20, and the committee’s firm view that these are very important grants to improve the socioeconomic situations of the vulnerable and",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 118 the poor; the Ministers of finance, health, basic education, human settlements and agriculture should ensure that concrete steps are taken to address challenges which impact grant expenditures and performance intending to improve service delivery and ensure that there is full compliance with each conditional grant framework. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development; the Minister of Basic Education; the Minister of Health; and the Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation. The Minister of Finance should ensure that additional allocations for drought relief for all provinces are considered during the 2020 adjustments budget, in light of the fact that the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs declared South Africa a disaster‐drought area on 26 February 2020. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill (2020) Government must improve and strengthen its financial management systems and internal controls units; appoint proper audit committees; and design and develop focused, properly aligned monitoring and evaluation systems with credible strategic plans across government to ensure that allocated resources are spent effectively and strictly according to the framework of the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill [2020] in order to prevent wasteful and fruitless expenditure, irregularities and corruption with COVID‐19 relief funds. Parliament, provincial legislatures and municipal councils should monitor the implementation through rigorous oversight and in‐year monitoring programmes. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. Provincial and municipal spending related to COVID‐19 is monitored through a range of mechanisms. The National Treasury also issued additional regulatory requirements in May 2020 to balance the need for flexibility with internal controls and risk management. Ultimately, municipal accounting officers are accountable for how funds are used. Municipalities are responsible for informing their communities of COVID‐19‐related spending and communities can monitor municipalities to ensure that the funds are spent as intended. The Department of Basic Education (DBE), together with provincial education departments, should address the issues around the shortage of teachers due to co‐morbidities and the shortage of personal protective equipment as this puts the lives of learners and teachers at high risk. Furthermore, the DBE and provincial education departments should expedite the process of implementing proper permanent structures for water provision in schools, given that the trucking system is an expensive option. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Basic Education and provincial departments of education. The National Disaster Management Centre, together with the provincial departments of agriculture, should expedite the finalisation of research to establish the appropriate figure for the amounts required for national disasters, especially for provinces that are severely affected. Such relief will protect food security and jobs, given the state of national disaster declared by government in February this year. The committee also believes that more allocations are required to be earmarked for the comprehensive agricultural support programme grant to further enhance food security and jobs for poor and vulnerable South Africans, especially during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 119 With regard to the additional R3.4 billion for the COVID‐19 component of the HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and community outreach grant, the committee acknowledges that provincial governments have a prerogative to decide how to spend the allocated funds; however, the National Treasury, together with the Department of Health, should ensure that these funds are spent according to the requirements of the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill [2020] framework and ensure that section 38(1)(b) and (c) of the Public Finance Management Act (1999), and other proper governance measures are properly implemented by provincial health departments to safeguard the management of the allocation. Provinces should further expedite the process of determining appropriate criteria to reprioritise the R20 billion within their allocated resources without disadvantaging the most rural and poor areas. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Health. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Health, should ensure that adequate resources are made available to expedite the implementation of national health insurance (NHI) to ensure that the implementation of the much needed universal access to healthcare services is achieved for the benefit of the poor and vulnerable, especially during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Health. While acknowledging the importance of fighting the COVID‐19 pandemic successfully, the committee is also of the view that National Treasury should ensure that a balanced approach is implemented, wherein efforts tailored to fight COVID‐19 do not undermine the much needed economic resuscitation, social transformation interventions and goals and targets of the National Development Plan. Reprioritisation of funds should not be to the detriment of core business and frontline service delivery and programmes aimed at economic recovery, such as infrastructure projects, which will ultimately compromise government efforts to resuscitate the economy. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation and looks forward to engaging with the committee on the details of measures to support economic recovery and service delivery. The National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and SALGA should ensure that municipalities implement consequence management and hold those who have transgressed accountable and recover any funds lost as a result of corruption before and during the COVID‐19 pandemic. They should further ensure that proper governance and financial control systems, as well as effective supply chain management are in place to prevent financial mismanagement and wasteful and fruitless expenditure and to safeguard the additional allocations to local government, while at the same time improving municipal audit outcomes. This should assist municipalities to provide personal protective equipment and ensure the sanitisation of taxi ranks. The extraction of political and administrative accountability as part of enforcing consequence management for municipalities by SALGA should be supported. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and SALGA. The National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and SALGA should work together to strengthen the level of support given to municipalities who are struggling to address revenue shortfalls as a result of the COVID‐19 pandemic; and the circulars issued by the National Treasury as standard guidelines for municipal procurement and reporting for COVID‐19 should be enforced to ensure that proper management of expenditure for COVID‐19 is achieved. Furthermore, the allocation for implementing the district development model, to ensure alignment and avoid duplication across spheres, should be clearly reflected in the budget. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and SALGA.",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 120 The National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and SALGA should ensure that all municipalities owing Eskom settle their financial obligations and all government departments owing municipalities also settle their obligations to assist in addressing municipal revenue shortfalls as a result of COVID‐19. They should further ensure that debt collection and credit control mechanisms are properly implemented. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and SALGA. The National Treasury should conduct proper impact assessment to identify and address the root causes of underspending before taking away or reprioritising resources from underspending programmes. The committee believes that this can only be used as a last resort as it negatively affects the poorer communities who depend on government services at a local government level. Different types of constructive interventions, including addressing the root causes of underexpenditure, should be identified and implemented to support struggling municipalities to ensure effective and efficient spending, and ultimately, value for money. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. Two of the main reasons for underspending are poor project preparation and frequent changes in the authorities. The budget allocates substantial resources to build capacity. Withholding funds is always implemented as a last resort. The National Treasury, the Department of Public Service and Administration and SALGA should ensure that wage negotiations are conducted fairly; and urgently resolve all labour‐related matters without creating instability, especially on local government level and in frontline services, which will compromise the much‐needed delivery of basic services to poor and vulnerable South Africans during this time of COVID‐19. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Public Service and Administration and SALGA. The Minister of Finance and the National Treasury should ensure that adequate consultation is conducted with both the provincial and local government spheres, as part of improving intergovernmental relations, prior to any reprioritisation of funds. The committee will monitor this in future and require the National Treasury to report on the extent of its consultation with the provinces and local government on budgets. The National Treasury consults extensively with provinces, municipalities and SALGA through the Budget Council, Budget Forum and other engagements. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Second Amendment Bill (2020) The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury gazettes the corrections to the following conditional grant frameworks, as set out in the bill in accordance with section 16(4) of the Division of Revenue Act (2020) as soon as possible:  The health facility revitalisation component of the NHI indirect grant  The framework of the rural roads asset management systems grant  Allocations for ring‐fenced sport projects in the municipal infrastructure grant. These corrections were gazetted shortly after the bill was tabled. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 121 The National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, should conduct a service delivery impact assessment emanating from the proposed budget cuts in local and provincial government to raise R10.5 billion for the SAA business rescue plan. This should demonstrate how these cuts will affect the implementation of the National Development Plan and the medium‐term strategic framework, and poor and vulnerable South Africans. This report should include measures taken by government to mitigate the possible impact on the poor and vulnerable. Furthermore, the Minister of Finance, together with Cabinet, should ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent the movement of funds from already distressed and dysfunctional municipalities and infrastructure programmes to bail out mismanaged state‐owned entities at the expense of service delivery. The movement of funds should not infringe on the constitutional rights of poor and vulnerable South Africans. The National Treasury should report on this during the 2021 Budget tabling. The National Treasury agrees that it is important to consider the effect of reductions on service delivery. The recommendation has been referred to the sector departments that are administering the grants as the assessment of service delivery falls within their mandate. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considers past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant real growth in allocations in recent years. While the committee welcomes the additional R1.5 billion in response to job losses resulting from the COVID‐19 pandemic, allocated as part of the stimulus package to create job opportunities through labour intensive projects; the committee is of the view that the culture of poor planning, the lack of clear reporting frameworks and of timeous expenditure in such initiatives should be urgently addressed by government to avoid a repeat of the challenges reported in the Jobs Fund. The committee is of the view that lessons learned from the nine years of implementing the Jobs Fund can assist to improve the work of the Presidential Employment Initiative to achieve better results. Parliament and provincial legislatures will continue to monitor progress. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting. Moreover, funding was provided for projects that were ready for implementation, based on the strength of the application submitted. In order to prevent wasteful and fruitless expenditure, the Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Basic Education and the affected provincial departments of education and provincial treasuries, should ensure that concrete steps are taken to build and demonstrate the required capacity to spend the proposed addition of R7 billion to the provincial equitable share to employ education assistants at schools and to save governing body posts, as well as the R500 million added for food relief in response to COVID‐19. These steps should include developing clear systems to monitor and evaluate such expenditure to ensure that unnecessary problems are eliminated during food parcel distribution. The National Treasury should report on this during the tabling of the 2021 Budget. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting. With regards to the COVID‐19 economic relief package, the committee is mindful that the provincial sphere has committed to reprioritise R20 billion from its own provincial equitable share to the COVID‐19 response. However, the committee strongly recommends that all healthcare and frontline services budgets should be protected and provincial treasuries should put in place clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for expenditure and performance, to ensure that mismanagement of funds is prevented at all times. Parliament, together with provincial legislatures, should monitor progress through effective oversight and in‐year monitoring. The National Treasury should report on this during the tabling of the 2021 Budget. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and has referred it to the provincial treasuries.",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 122 The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury approves the roll‐overs for the following provincial and local government grants contained in the bill for all projects near completion timeously, in accordance with the necessary financial management prescripts:  The school infrastructure backlogs grant for the completion of projects that are part of the sanitation appropriate for education initiative earmarked for Eastern Cape, KwaZulu‐Natal and Limpopo schools  The urban settlements development grant to fund commitments for bulk infrastructure‐related projects in the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan municipality  The public transport network grant to continue with the roll‐out of integrated public transport network infrastructure in the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan municipality  The regional bulk infrastructure grant for drought and COVID‐19 water and sanitation interventions nationwide. The National Treasury only recommends rollovers where there is compliance with the legal regulations and practice notes. The rollovers mentioned above were approved before the Division of Revenue Second Amendment Bill was tabled. While the committee has noted the proposed reduction of R25.3 billion as part of the overall wage bill reduction of R160 billion to ensure fiscal consolidation and economic reconstruction and recovery; the committee recommends that the issue of the public wage bill should be discussed and concluded fairly and amicably in the Public Service Co‐ordinating Bargaining Council, as the most appropriate platform; and that such reductions should not affect the frontline service delivery workers, especially in poor municipalities and the departments of health, education and social development. The National Treasury notes this recommendation and it has been forwarded to the Minister of Public Service and Administration. While the allocation of R12 million, reprioritised into the indirect component of the water services infrastructure grant, for the implementation of various water services interventions, is a step in the right direction; the committee recommends that more resources should be found for the Department of Water and Sanitation and the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development and Land Reform to address the persistent water crisis and drought affecting some provinces, in order to protect food security. Both water and agricultural grants can be used to respond to drought. Additional funding can be allocated through disaster grants once a disaster is declared. As noted at the beginning of this section, there is little scope to provide additional funding at this time. The finalisation of the draft Public Procurement Bill should be expedited to ensure that the majority of South Africans participate in the economic mainstream. The Minister of Finance, together with the Ministers of economic development; trade, industry and competition; and employment and labour, should address the economic barriers, social inequality, and societal polarisation by adopting a localised product value chain approach. The expression of this approach should also be found in the incentive frameworks of both provincial and local conditional grants as hard conditions to permit procurement of goods only if they are made or assembled locally within the South African borders; to stimulate the domestic economy and inclusive growth and encourage local opportunities while taking international trade agreements into consideration. The economic recovery plan announced by the President in October 2020 largely addresses this recommendation. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 123 The committee appeals to the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and SALGA to continue to support municipalities to resolve the Eskom and water boards debt issue; and to ensure that the matter of provincial and national departments owing municipalities are also expeditiously addressed to bolster municipal finances, as opposed to implementing budget cuts in local government. They should further ensure that municipalities create credible credit control measures, debt management policies and effective revenue collection strategies; and should provide a progress report in this regard during the tabling of the 2021 Budget. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. Managing municipal revenue is a shared responsibility. Government is strengthening national coordination through the single and integrated revenue management framework, which improves collaboration between the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance as they enter a municipality. The framework will assist with planning and budgeting, programme design and implementation. The National Treasury has also placed revenue advisors at each provincial treasury. These advisors will help capacitate the provincial treasuries on revenue initiatives for municipalities and assist municipalities to address inefficiencies in revenue management. The Minister of Finance and Cabinet should take concrete steps to prevent the mismanagement of COVID‐19 funds and to ensure that consequence management is enforced for corruption and malfeasance during personal protective equipment procurement processes. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Health, should table a detailed COVID‐19 expenditure and performance report in Parliament, including how the remaining funds will be appropriated. The Minister of Finance and other Ministers should also ensure that the National Treasury and other departments avail the necessary performance information when requested by oversight and government advisory bodies, such as the FFC, to conduct impact assessments. The National Treasury agrees that this information should be provided when requested for oversight. The National Treasury issued additional requirements in a May 2020 circular to balance the need for flexibility with sufficient internal controls and risk management in responding to COVID‐19. Information on companies that were awarded the personal protective equipment tenders has been published on the National Treasury website. The Ministers of social development and basic education, together with the Minister of Finance, should ensure that proper financial management mechanisms are put in place to prevent wastage and fruitless expenditure of the funds allocated to early childhood development (R496 million) and school sanitation (R475 million); and further explore ways to retain the long term unemployment grant of R350 for unemployed individuals between the ages of 18 and 59. This could provide a safety net for the poorest of the poor, even though it will never be enough to cater for all, considering the current economic situation across South Africa. The National Treasury agrees that the funds should be used efficiently. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting. Given the current economic situation, with declining revenue collection and a rising budget deficit, the committee recommends that government should continue to make use of all legislative measures at its disposal to fight corruption, including recovering monies which have been lost as a result of wrongdoing, whether in state capture, personal protective equipment procurement projects or government officials who contravene public finance management and supply chain management prescripts. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation. While the committee appreciates that COVID‐19 challenges led to the MTBPS being introduced in Parliament a week later, it has meant that the usual tight time frame for processing the bill was",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 124 intensified this year, and the committee and the provincial legislatures would have wanted to give more rigorous attention to the bill. We urge the Minister of Finance to introduce the MTBPS timeously in future. The committee believes that the House Chairpersons of both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces need to look into the possibilities of giving the council more time and space to process the MTBPS in future. The National Treasury notes this concern. While recognising the specific time constraints this year, and other stresses of the National Treasury, the committee believes that the National Treasury’s responses to the concerns of the provincial legislatures were inadequate and recommends that it provide more effective responses in future. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. It responds within its mandate. The committee believes that the reviews of the provincial and local government equitable shares need to be finalised urgently, as it has been on the agenda for a long time and numerous recommendations have repeatedly been made by the committee, SALGA, the FFC and other stakeholders. The matter is now even more urgent, given the impact of COVID‐19 on the provinces and, particularly local government, whose finances are in a perilous state anyway. These reviews need to involve all three spheres of government and other relevant stakeholders, as well as independent technical experts. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance, SALGA and the FFC, is part of a standing technical committee that regularly discusses issues relating to the local government equitable share. In 2013/14, a new local equitable share formula was introduced based on work by committee members. This formula is updated annually through the committee. In December 2020, the Budget Forum agreed that all matters relating to the local government fiscal framework will be managed collaboratively between the National Treasury, the department and SALGA. The National Treasury, provincial treasuries, the FFC, other national departments and independent technical experts are reviewing the provincial equitable share and will publish the results as soon as they are available. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Bill (2020) That the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport provide a report on the possible impact of the R2.8 billion reductions on the provincial roads maintenance grant. Considering the poor state of the provincial road network, the Ministers must provide the committee with alternative viable solutions on how to fund the maintenance of the provincial road network in all the provinces affected by these cuts, the poor provinces in particular. The grant is intended to supplement transfers from the provincial equitable share to fund the maintenance and upgrading of provincial roads. Provinces are expected to fund the construction of new roads from their own budgets. That the Minister of Finance and Minister of Basic Education provide a report on the implications of the R1.9 billion reductions in the education infrastructure grant. The committee views this grant as critical in providing education infrastructure in particular to the previously disadvantaged communities. Each Ministry should report the rationale and implications of the R1.9 billion reductions in this grant given its importance in providing education infrastructure. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considers past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 125 real growth in allocations in recent years. The education infrastructure grant was allocated R35 billion, and grows at an average annual rate of 5.2 per cent over the 2020 MTEF period, including the reductions. While these reductions will delay the delivery of infrastructure projects, all planned projects are still expected to be completed. The Minister of Basic Education should report on the implications of these budget reductions on the education infrastructure grant and provide a list of the affected provinces and the list of the education infrastructure projects affected. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Basic Education. That the Minister of Basic Education provides a comprehensive report on the impact of the R123 million reduction over the MTEF period on the school infrastructure backlogs grant which is meant for the eradication and replacement of inappropriate schools and related school furniture. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Basic Education. That the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Transport, the Minster of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs, SALGA, and the Msunduzi, Buffalo City, and Mbombela municipalities should report on the possible financial and service delivery implications resulting from the R4.3 billion reductions in the public transport network grant over the MTEF period. The aforementioned parties should report to the committee as follows: The Minister of Finance should demonstrate how, over the years, this grant has underperformed in these affected municipalities, what has been the expenditure patterns versus infrastructure investment as required by the grant framework. The Minister should also provide demonstrable evidence that the National Treasury has over time assisted these affected cities without success. In 2019/20, Mbombela, Buffalo City and Msunduzi were suspended from the public transport network grant. This decision was made on the basis of consistent underperformance. Although the grant was initiated in 2006/07, the three cities have not moved past the planning stage of their public transport projects. By the end of 2019/20, about R861 million had been allocated to Buffalo City, R1.7 billion to Mbombela and R1.4 billion to Msunduzi under this grant. To date, the cities have not delivered any public transport services with these funds. The Department of Transport is responsible for administering this grant, therefore it would be best placed to provide data showing spending patterns against infrastructure investment. The National Treasury has supported cities participating in this grant by procuring transport experts to assist the cities with financial planning to ensure their transport systems are fiscally and financially sustainable, and by offering support through relevant experts such as the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer. The Minister of Transport should explain the steps that the department had taken to assist these cities who are currently suspended from the grant. Furthermore, the Minister of Transport should provide a report on the possible implications for the suspension of these cities from the grant in light of what the Department of Transport’s public transport strategy envisages. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Transport. The Minister of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) should clarify the steps that the department implemented over time in order to fast‐track the implementation of this grant and what appears to be the challenges in these cities and how COGTA was assisting these municipalities through available intergovernmental processes. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Cooperative Governance.",

That the Mbombela, Buffalo City, and Msunduzi municipalities should appear before the committee to explain in detail the challenges faced by these cities in spending and implementing the public network grant according to the grant framework.

    "recommendation": "19 response, including a social and economic relief package. Accordingly, no significant effect on service delivery is expected as most affected programmes are delayed. The Minister of Finance ensures that the National Treasury provides a comprehensive report on how the National Treasury plans to fund infrastructure spending aimed at reconstruction, rehabilitating and maintaining social and economic infrastructure such as schools, roads and other government infrastructure assets after COVID‐19. The committee is concerned that a lack of a detailed and proper infrastructure recovery plan will lead government to the same path as is currently experienced with Eskom infrastructure maintenance related challenges. This plan should signal the National Treasury’s commitment on funding public infrastructure for reconstruction, maintenance and rehabilitation, while also outlining potential future costs escalations due to delays in funding these key government infrastructure activities and estimated costs overruns of delayed infrastructure projects. This report should be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. The 2020 MTBPS provided a description of the measures to support economic growth, including the funding for infrastructure and the economic development function. In line with the pronouncements made by the President on infrastructure investments for both economic growth stimulation and job creation, the Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury provides a comprehensive report on how this bill responds to the pronouncements made by the President on infrastructure investment. This report should be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. The 2020 MTBPS provided a description of the measures to support economic growth, including the funding for infrastructure and the economic development function. The Minister of Basic Education ensure that the Department of Basic Education submit a detailed report to the committee on the impact of reducing the education infrastructure grant and detailed recovery ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 127 plan for school infrastructure reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance. Given the reports on the number of schools vandalised and destroyed during the lockdown period, the department must also include a detailed list of these schools per province and present a detailed maintenance recovery plan of these schools. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Basic Education. That the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs facilitates and ensure engagements between the National Treasury and SALGA so as to resolve the revenue and capacity challenges at the local sphere of government. The committee should be provided with a report on the outcomes of these engagements before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. The National Treasury is implementing this recommendation, as outlined in a previous response above. The Minister of Finance jointly with the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs provide a comprehensive report on how all the municipalities placed under section 139 interventions were monitored and assisted in responding to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Considering that some of these municipalities were showing slow to no signs of improvements, this report must be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. The National Treasury will provide this report. On a monthly basis, the National Treasury monitors these municipalities if they have financial recovery plans. This practice continued during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Many municipalities under intervention do not implement their financial recovery plans as required and are advised to do so. Municipalities under intervention were generally unable to quantify the effect of the pandemic on their financial position. In most cases, the effect on municipal revenues tended to be overstated in anticipation of additional financial relief. These municipalities will be assisted through revised financial recovery plans focusing on adjustments to their expenditure. That National Treasury reconsiders the approach of reprioritisation of funds away from the urban settlements development grant in particular and focus more on enhancing the capacity at local government level to effectively, efficiently and economically spend the grant allocations. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Government spends approximately R2.5 billion per year on building capacity in local government and is reviewing the effectiveness of these capacity‐ building programmes. That the relevant Parliamentary portfolio committees should also follow up on issues of poor performance and underspending on key infrastructure grant allocations which have been raised in this report. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. Departments are accountable for spending and performance on grant allocations that they administer. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Second Amendment Bill (2020) In relation to the proposed R1.3 billion reduction in provincial conditional grants allocation to fund the SAA business rescue plan, the Minister of Finance must ensure that the National Treasury provides the committee with an impact assessment report on all provincial conditional grants allocations which were reduced to fund the SAA business rescue plan. The report must highlight the service delivery implications for these proposed grants allocation reduction.

In that report, the National Treasury must indicate how much each of these affected municipalities owes Eskom for electricity services and the water boards for water. The National Treasury has provided these details. All the reports requested above be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2021 Budget to allow the committee sufficient time to analyse the information before the consideration and reporting on the 2021 Budget bills.

This will allow the committee to consider all the information before it and report to the National Assembly in terms of section 4(4)(a) of the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act, No 9 of 2009. The National Treasury admits in the 2020 MTBPS that these unpaid invoices present a serious risk to government finances, therefore the committee cannot allow this situation to escalate to the levels where Eskom finds itself in regarding the municipal debt. The committee is also of the view that if this problem is not addressed, it has a potential to compromise the credibility of government budget. The National Treasury will provide the information as captured by national and provincial departments in the annual financial statements that are submitted to the Auditor‐General. The Minister of Finance ensures that the National Treasury provides the committee with the set of conditions that must be met for the provisional funding to be made available in 2021/22 to build the Tygerberg Regional Hospital and Klipfontein Hospital in the Western Cape. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation and will provide the information directly to the committee. Report of the Standing and Select Committees on Finance on the 2020 Revised Fiscal Framework The special adjustments budget does not provide enough clarity on infrastructure development projects – and this is utterly crucial to our economic recovery. The National Treasury needs to report on this at its next quarterly briefing. The Appropriations Committee also needs to consider taking this forward. A detailed pipeline of bankable projects is shared in the 2020 Budget Review. The National Treasury has been working with the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) and the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure to operationalise the Infrastructure Fund. A briefing should ideally be provided by all three parties, and in this regard, an opportunity to brief the committee will be welcome. We recommend that the Minister of Finance reports quarterly on the effectiveness of the National Treasury’s debt management strategies that would ensure that the level of debt stabilises over the medium term and avoids a sovereign debt crisis. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and will provide quarterly reports. It publishes a public debt management report every year. The Minister of Finance should brief the committee on progress made with the development of the State Bank. The National Treasury will endeavour to brief the committee. There are currently several state banks in existence, often with overlapping mandates. The key challenge is to rationalise and consolidate these banks, and ensure they are able to generate sufficient revenue to fund their operations without relying on government funding. The National Treasury is also considering how best to address market failures and gaps in the current banking system, given the need to prioritise financial inclusion.",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 112 The committee notes that the National Treasury is working on the details of the R100 billion set aside as one of the economic support measures for job creation, to ensure proper processes are in place to roll out projects over the medium term. The National Treasury should provide the committee with more detail regarding how the money will be spent, in which sectors, and what type of jobs will be created. The Presidency oversees the programme and reports are consolidated therein. Departments will also submit spending and performance information in line with requirements of the National Treasury regulations. The committee requires the National Treasury to brief it on why “zero‐based budgeting” is being proposed, how will it be implemented and what its implications are. The National Treasury welcomes the opportunity to brief the committee at its earliest convenience. Since June 2020, the National Treasury has been reviewing government spending to improve efficiency. More than 30 spending reviews across all functions have been conducted to understand service‐ delivery outcomes and how these might change under different scenarios. These reviews will be used to inform the development of zero‐based budgeting. Report of the Standing and Select Committees on Finance on the 2020 second Revised Fiscal Framework While the committee notes that the assigning of the high‐demand digital spectrum and reducing the cost of broadband and other costs of doing business forms part of the measures of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, it is still concerned at the slow pace of the auctioning of the digital spectrum and persistent high costs of broadband to consumers. The committee reiterates that the National Treasury needs to engage with the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services on this. Given the desperate need for revenue, the committee urges government to accelerate the auctioning of the digital spectrum. The National Treasury agrees with the committee and engagements are ongoing. In the 2020 MTBPS, government allocated an additional R84.7 million to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa in 2020/21 for the licensing of high‐demand spectrum. The amount of revenue collected will depend on the design of the auction process and how mobile operators respond. The committee reiterates its disappointment that there has only been 8 per cent take up of the loan guarantee scheme of R200 billion. The committee requires the National Treasury to report to it on its renegotiation of the lending criteria with the participating commercial banks. The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance considers the expansion of this loan guarantee scheme to directly include development financial institutions being able to provide liquidity to projects that they are directly funding. The National Treasury welcomes the opportunity to brief the committee at its earliest convenience. The committee reiterates its view expressed in its special adjustment budget report that: “Government should engage with all stakeholders, including the private sector on how to unlock domestic investment through impact investments and Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act [1956]. NT needs to consider creating the necessary regulatory mechanisms to ensure increased pension fund investments directly into infrastructure projects including real estate, which can unlock capital that currently is not finding its way into projects. The majority in the Committee believes there should be more engagement on the feasibility of prescribing assets for pension funds and will request a presentation by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and NT on this when the FSCA releases the policy paper as announced by the Minister of Finance in his post‐adjustment budget briefing to the Committee. National Treasury should ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 also consider how pension fund members can leverage their retirement fund assets to improve their personal financial circumstances...” Alongside the 2020 MTBPS, the National Treasury released an explanatory note on financial sector updates including the review of Regulation 28 – to allow retirement funds to invest more in infrastructure – and, under certain conditions, early access to retirement savings. Annexure F provides an update on these matters. The committee requires the National Treasury (and SARS) to update it in the 2021 Budget Review on the developments in resolving the impasse on the taxing rights of countries when it comes to income derived from digital activities. The committee is aware that South Africa is one of the few countries that are already collecting VAT from the digital economy and commends this. The committee recommends that while the National Treasury participates in the Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD), it should work in collaboration with the African Tax Administration Forum on the digital tax framework. The National Treasury welcomes the opportunity to brief the committee at its earliest convenience. As a member of the Steering Group of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, the African Tax Administration Forum and G24, South Africa is actively involved in finding a consensus‐ based solution on addressing the income tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Adjustments Appropriation Bill That the Minister of Finance ensures that the National Treasury provides a comprehensive report on how it plans to fund infrastructure spending aimed at reconstruction, rehabilitating and maintaining social and economic infrastructure such as schools, roads and other government infrastructure assets post COVID‐19. The committee is concerned that a lack of a detailed and proper infrastructure recovery plan will lead government to the same path it is currently experiencing with Eskom infrastructure maintenance‐related challenges. This plan should signal the National Treasury’s commitment on funding public infrastructure for reconstruction, maintenance and rehabilitation, while also outlining potential future costs escalations due to delays in funding these key government infrastructure activities and estimated costs overruns of delayed infrastructure projects. This report should be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. Government has radically restructured its infrastructure delivery model. A new institution, Infrastructure South Africa, has been established by Cabinet to oversee and coordinate public infrastructure delivery. In February 2020, the Minister of Finance announced that government is expected to spend R815 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. Of this, spending on economic infrastructure, mainly by state‐owned companies, accounted for 75.1 per cent, while spending on social infrastructure accounted for 20.9 per cent of the total. The Infrastructure Fund is a key element of the economic recovery plan. It aims to diversify government funding sources available for infrastructure by combining capital from the public and private sectors, development finance institutions and multilateral development banks. It will harness skills and capacity from the private sector to improve the quality of planning, enhance the speed and quality of spending, and reduce the cost of infrastructure. This in turn will contribute to the growth of the economy and to increased productivity and employment creation. In line with the pronouncements made by the President on infrastructure investments for both economic growth stimulation and job creation, the Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury provides a comprehensive report on how this bill responds to the pronouncements made by the",

While the committee welcomes the expansion of access to early childhood development services, which will reach almost 700 000 children under the age of four years in 2022/23, and the additional R1.4 billion for the early childhood development grant to increase the subsidy per child from R15 per day to R17 per day in 2020/21, increasing to R18.57 per day by 2022/23, the committee is of the view that this is a crucial conditional grant for early childhood development and therefore recommends that the Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Social Development and provincial treasuries, ensure that proper mechanisms are developed and put in place to comply with the grant framework, improve the grant expenditure and grant performance, given the 2019/20 grant performance picture demonstrated by some provinces. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. The Department of Social Development is responsible for administering this grant and ensuring that its conditions are met. The National Treasury will continue to work with the department and provincial treasuries to oversee grant spending. This recommendation is also referred to the Minister of Social Development and provincial treasuries. Due to the importance of education in our country which aims to empower citizens to fight unemployment, inequalities and poverty as well as the need to address education infrastructure backlogs in certain areas, especially in schools where the state of infrastructure poses a danger to pupils, the National Treasury should review the baseline reduction of the education infrastructure grant and the school infrastructure backlogs grant for the MTEF period and, furthermore, the national electrification programme grants should also be considered based on their evidence and merits. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considered past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant real growth in allocations in recent years. It is anticipated that, although these reductions might delay",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 116 the start of new infrastructure projects this year, provinces and municipalities will be able to implement existing projects with the remaining allocation. Both the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance, together with provincial treasuries and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA), should intensify efforts to support local government interventions to improve revenue collection, such as the pilot project to retrofit smart meters, and report the progress to Parliament in the next budget cycle; as this requires sector committees also to play their oversight role. Furthermore, sound debt recovery strategies and mechanisms are required to improve revenue collection. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. Managing municipal revenue is a shared responsibility. Government is strengthening national coordination through the single and integrated revenue management framework, which improves collaboration between the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance as they enter a municipality. The framework will assist with planning and budgeting, programme design and implementation. The National Treasury has also placed revenue advisors at each provincial treasury. These advisors will help capacitate the provincial treasuries on revenue initiatives for municipalities and assist municipalities to address inefficiencies in revenue management. In addition, a Multidisciplinary Revenue Committee has been established to strengthen collaboration and address fragmentation on revenue issues. The committee includes the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance, the Department of Public Enterprises, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure, the Department of Water and Sanitation, Eskom, SALGA and the National Energy Regulator of South Africa. The committee will focus on four recommendations that Cabinet approved in 2018: a national campaign to pay for services, the introduction of smart meters for electricity and water, the restructuring of arrear debt for Eskom and water services, and the development of a process to deal with defaulting municipalities. In addition, it will proactively address shortfalls within municipal revenues. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance, provincial treasuries and SALGA, should ensure that municipalities develop and provide proper plans and mechanisms in line with the COVID‐19 interventions for the additional R20 billion allocation proposed by government for municipalities, to avoid wasteful and fruitless expenditure, and such mechanisms should ensure that consequence management prevails wherever there is corruption and mismanagement of funds. The committee believes that this will go a long way in addressing issues such as additional responsibilities posed by COVID‐19 regulations, unemployment, irrecoverable debts and budget shortfalls. The National Treasury agrees that municipalities should avoid wasteful and fruitless expenditure. The COVID‐19 pandemic required flexibility to adapt to rapidly evolving circumstances. Of the R20 billion provided for municipalities, R11 billion was added through the local government equitable share to allow municipalities discretion to respond to local conditions. The remaining funds were provided through existing conditional grants with specific conditions. Additional conditions were added to some grants to allow for spending in response to COVID‐19. With regard to the suspension of the public transport network grant for Buffalo City metropolitan municipality, Mbombela and Msunduzi local municipalities, and given the fact that this is a much needed programme to improve public transport networks, address commuter inequalities and reduce road fatalities; the Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the Minister of Transport, relevant provincial treasuries and SALGA should take drastic measures to ensure that adequate support and capacity development interventions are tailored to resolve the matter speedily and ensure that, once restored, the conditional grant achieves its intended outcomes. The committee will continue to monitor progress in this regard. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation and will continue supporting the cities to realise the objectives of the grant. With regard to the baseline reduction of the provincial roads maintenance grant, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport should thoroughly assess and consider the service delivery implications, given the poor status of road maintenance in some provinces and the level of road carnage which ultimately cost the state a lot of money, before the baseline reduction of R2.8 billion over the medium term is effected. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considers past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant real growth in allocations in recent years. This grant is intended to supplement transfers from the provincial equitable share to fund the maintenance and upgrading of provincial roads. Provinces are expected to fund the construction of new roads from their own budgets. The Department of Transport should expedite the finalisation of the transport subsidy policy which will include improving public transport for rural commuters and address inequalities. On the other hand, the National Treasury should support government efforts to intensify rural development intervention programmes to ensure that public service centres are geared towards local people, particularly townships and poor rural communities. The sector committees should monitor progress on the policy development front, while the Select Committee on Appropriations will monitor budget implementation once such a policy is concluded. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Transport. The committee notes the views suggesting that the local equitable share of 9 per cent of the nationally raised revenue is not cost‐reflective and, therefore, not adequate to fund local government functions. The committee is of the view that SALGA, together with the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), should work together to consider scientific evidence available to help review the local government equitable share formula in a fair and equitable manner. The committee will continue to monitor progress in this regard. This recommendation is in effect. The National Treasury, together with the other specified departments and entities, is part of a standing technical committee that regularly discusses issues relating to the local government equitable share. In 2013/14, a new equitable share formula was introduced based on work by committee members. This formula is updated annually through the committee. While the committee understands the need for budget reprioritisation over the 2020 MTEF, due to the current economic outlook, the committee is of the firm view that these budget cuts should not compromise provincial and local government frontline service delivery points, especially where more human capital is required, and personnel at lower levels should continue to be protected. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. It is important that service delivery implications are considered alongside the need to balance the fiscal framework. Reductions to provincial and local government conditional grants were necessary to meet urgent spending needs related to the COVID‐19 pandemic. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considers past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant real growth in allocations in recent years. Given the underexpenditure and underperformance of certain conditional grants such as the human papillomavirus grant; the maths, science and technology grant; the learners with profound intellectual disabilities grant; the title deeds restoration grant; and the comprehensive agricultural support programme grant; as reported during the in‐year monitoring for 2019/20, and the committee’s firm view that these are very important grants to improve the socioeconomic situations of the vulnerable and",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 118 the poor; the Ministers of finance, health, basic education, human settlements and agriculture should ensure that concrete steps are taken to address challenges which impact grant expenditures and performance intending to improve service delivery and ensure that there is full compliance with each conditional grant framework. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development; the Minister of Basic Education; the Minister of Health; and the Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation. The Minister of Finance should ensure that additional allocations for drought relief for all provinces are considered during the 2020 adjustments budget, in light of the fact that the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs declared South Africa a disaster‐drought area on 26 February 2020. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill (2020) Government must improve and strengthen its financial management systems and internal controls units; appoint proper audit committees; and design and develop focused, properly aligned monitoring and evaluation systems with credible strategic plans across government to ensure that allocated resources are spent effectively and strictly according to the framework of the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill [2020] in order to prevent wasteful and fruitless expenditure, irregularities and corruption with COVID‐19 relief funds. Parliament, provincial legislatures and municipal councils should monitor the implementation through rigorous oversight and in‐year monitoring programmes. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. Provincial and municipal spending related to COVID‐19 is monitored through a range of mechanisms. The National Treasury also issued additional regulatory requirements in May 2020 to balance the need for flexibility with internal controls and risk management. Ultimately, municipal accounting officers are accountable for how funds are used. Municipalities are responsible for informing their communities of COVID‐19‐related spending and communities can monitor municipalities to ensure that the funds are spent as intended. The Department of Basic Education (DBE), together with provincial education departments, should address the issues around the shortage of teachers due to co‐morbidities and the shortage of personal protective equipment as this puts the lives of learners and teachers at high risk. Furthermore, the DBE and provincial education departments should expedite the process of implementing proper permanent structures for water provision in schools, given that the trucking system is an expensive option. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Basic Education and provincial departments of education. The National Disaster Management Centre, together with the provincial departments of agriculture, should expedite the finalisation of research to establish the appropriate figure for the amounts required for national disasters, especially for provinces that are severely affected. Such relief will protect food security and jobs, given the state of national disaster declared by government in February this year. The committee also believes that more allocations are required to be earmarked for the comprehensive agricultural support programme grant to further enhance food security and jobs for poor and vulnerable South Africans, especially during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 119 With regard to the additional R3.4 billion for the COVID‐19 component of the HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and community outreach grant, the committee acknowledges that provincial governments have a prerogative to decide how to spend the allocated funds; however, the National Treasury, together with the Department of Health, should ensure that these funds are spent according to the requirements of the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill [2020] framework and ensure that section 38(1)(b) and (c) of the Public Finance Management Act (1999), and other proper governance measures are properly implemented by provincial health departments to safeguard the management of the allocation. Provinces should further expedite the process of determining appropriate criteria to reprioritise the R20 billion within their allocated resources without disadvantaging the most rural and poor areas. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Health. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Health, should ensure that adequate resources are made available to expedite the implementation of national health insurance (NHI) to ensure that the implementation of the much needed universal access to healthcare services is achieved for the benefit of the poor and vulnerable, especially during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Health. While acknowledging the importance of fighting the COVID‐19 pandemic successfully, the committee is also of the view that National Treasury should ensure that a balanced approach is implemented, wherein efforts tailored to fight COVID‐19 do not undermine the much needed economic resuscitation, social transformation interventions and goals and targets of the National Development Plan. Reprioritisation of funds should not be to the detriment of core business and frontline service delivery and programmes aimed at economic recovery, such as infrastructure projects, which will ultimately compromise government efforts to resuscitate the economy. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation and looks forward to engaging with the committee on the details of measures to support economic recovery and service delivery. The National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and SALGA should ensure that municipalities implement consequence management and hold those who have transgressed accountable and recover any funds lost as a result of corruption before and during the COVID‐19 pandemic. They should further ensure that proper governance and financial control systems, as well as effective supply chain management are in place to prevent financial mismanagement and wasteful and fruitless expenditure and to safeguard the additional allocations to local government, while at the same time improving municipal audit outcomes. This should assist municipalities to provide personal protective equipment and ensure the sanitisation of taxi ranks. The extraction of political and administrative accountability as part of enforcing consequence management for municipalities by SALGA should be supported. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and SALGA. The National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and SALGA should work together to strengthen the level of support given to municipalities who are struggling to address revenue shortfalls as a result of the COVID‐19 pandemic; and the circulars issued by the National Treasury as standard guidelines for municipal procurement and reporting for COVID‐19 should be enforced to ensure that proper management of expenditure for COVID‐19 is achieved. Furthermore, the allocation for implementing the district development model, to ensure alignment and avoid duplication across spheres, should be clearly reflected in the budget. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and SALGA.",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 120 The National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and SALGA should ensure that all municipalities owing Eskom settle their financial obligations and all government departments owing municipalities also settle their obligations to assist in addressing municipal revenue shortfalls as a result of COVID‐19. They should further ensure that debt collection and credit control mechanisms are properly implemented. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and SALGA. The National Treasury should conduct proper impact assessment to identify and address the root causes of underspending before taking away or reprioritising resources from underspending programmes. The committee believes that this can only be used as a last resort as it negatively affects the poorer communities who depend on government services at a local government level. Different types of constructive interventions, including addressing the root causes of underexpenditure, should be identified and implemented to support struggling municipalities to ensure effective and efficient spending, and ultimately, value for money. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. Two of the main reasons for underspending are poor project preparation and frequent changes in the authorities. The budget allocates substantial resources to build capacity. Withholding funds is always implemented as a last resort. The National Treasury, the Department of Public Service and Administration and SALGA should ensure that wage negotiations are conducted fairly; and urgently resolve all labour‐related matters without creating instability, especially on local government level and in frontline services, which will compromise the much‐needed delivery of basic services to poor and vulnerable South Africans during this time of COVID‐19. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Public Service and Administration and SALGA. The Minister of Finance and the National Treasury should ensure that adequate consultation is conducted with both the provincial and local government spheres, as part of improving intergovernmental relations, prior to any reprioritisation of funds. The committee will monitor this in future and require the National Treasury to report on the extent of its consultation with the provinces and local government on budgets. The National Treasury consults extensively with provinces, municipalities and SALGA through the Budget Council, Budget Forum and other engagements. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Second Amendment Bill (2020) The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury gazettes the corrections to the following conditional grant frameworks, as set out in the bill in accordance with section 16(4) of the Division of Revenue Act (2020) as soon as possible:  The health facility revitalisation component of the NHI indirect grant  The framework of the rural roads asset management systems grant  Allocations for ring‐fenced sport projects in the municipal infrastructure grant. These corrections were gazetted shortly after the bill was tabled. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 121 The National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, should conduct a service delivery impact assessment emanating from the proposed budget cuts in local and provincial government to raise R10.5 billion for the SAA business rescue plan. This should demonstrate how these cuts will affect the implementation of the National Development Plan and the medium‐term strategic framework, and poor and vulnerable South Africans. This report should include measures taken by government to mitigate the possible impact on the poor and vulnerable. Furthermore, the Minister of Finance, together with Cabinet, should ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent the movement of funds from already distressed and dysfunctional municipalities and infrastructure programmes to bail out mismanaged state‐owned entities at the expense of service delivery. The movement of funds should not infringe on the constitutional rights of poor and vulnerable South Africans. The National Treasury should report on this during the 2021 Budget tabling. The National Treasury agrees that it is important to consider the effect of reductions on service delivery. The recommendation has been referred to the sector departments that are administering the grants as the assessment of service delivery falls within their mandate. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considers past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant real growth in allocations in recent years. While the committee welcomes the additional R1.5 billion in response to job losses resulting from the COVID‐19 pandemic, allocated as part of the stimulus package to create job opportunities through labour intensive projects; the committee is of the view that the culture of poor planning, the lack of clear reporting frameworks and of timeous expenditure in such initiatives should be urgently addressed by government to avoid a repeat of the challenges reported in the Jobs Fund. The committee is of the view that lessons learned from the nine years of implementing the Jobs Fund can assist to improve the work of the Presidential Employment Initiative to achieve better results. Parliament and provincial legislatures will continue to monitor progress. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting. Moreover, funding was provided for projects that were ready for implementation, based on the strength of the application submitted. In order to prevent wasteful and fruitless expenditure, the Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Basic Education and the affected provincial departments of education and provincial treasuries, should ensure that concrete steps are taken to build and demonstrate the required capacity to spend the proposed addition of R7 billion to the provincial equitable share to employ education assistants at schools and to save governing body posts, as well as the R500 million added for food relief in response to COVID‐19. These steps should include developing clear systems to monitor and evaluate such expenditure to ensure that unnecessary problems are eliminated during food parcel distribution. The National Treasury should report on this during the tabling of the 2021 Budget. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting. With regards to the COVID‐19 economic relief package, the committee is mindful that the provincial sphere has committed to reprioritise R20 billion from its own provincial equitable share to the COVID‐19 response. However, the committee strongly recommends that all healthcare and frontline services budgets should be protected and provincial treasuries should put in place clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for expenditure and performance, to ensure that mismanagement of funds is prevented at all times. Parliament, together with provincial legislatures, should monitor progress through effective oversight and in‐year monitoring. The National Treasury should report on this during the tabling of the 2021 Budget. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and has referred it to the provincial treasuries.",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 122 The Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury approves the roll‐overs for the following provincial and local government grants contained in the bill for all projects near completion timeously, in accordance with the necessary financial management prescripts:  The school infrastructure backlogs grant for the completion of projects that are part of the sanitation appropriate for education initiative earmarked for Eastern Cape, KwaZulu‐Natal and Limpopo schools  The urban settlements development grant to fund commitments for bulk infrastructure‐related projects in the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan municipality  The public transport network grant to continue with the roll‐out of integrated public transport network infrastructure in the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan municipality  The regional bulk infrastructure grant for drought and COVID‐19 water and sanitation interventions nationwide. The National Treasury only recommends rollovers where there is compliance with the legal regulations and practice notes. The rollovers mentioned above were approved before the Division of Revenue Second Amendment Bill was tabled. While the committee has noted the proposed reduction of R25.3 billion as part of the overall wage bill reduction of R160 billion to ensure fiscal consolidation and economic reconstruction and recovery; the committee recommends that the issue of the public wage bill should be discussed and concluded fairly and amicably in the Public Service Co‐ordinating Bargaining Council, as the most appropriate platform; and that such reductions should not affect the frontline service delivery workers, especially in poor municipalities and the departments of health, education and social development. The National Treasury notes this recommendation and it has been forwarded to the Minister of Public Service and Administration. While the allocation of R12 million, reprioritised into the indirect component of the water services infrastructure grant, for the implementation of various water services interventions, is a step in the right direction; the committee recommends that more resources should be found for the Department of Water and Sanitation and the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development and Land Reform to address the persistent water crisis and drought affecting some provinces, in order to protect food security. Both water and agricultural grants can be used to respond to drought. Additional funding can be allocated through disaster grants once a disaster is declared. As noted at the beginning of this section, there is little scope to provide additional funding at this time. The finalisation of the draft Public Procurement Bill should be expedited to ensure that the majority of South Africans participate in the economic mainstream. The Minister of Finance, together with the Ministers of economic development; trade, industry and competition; and employment and labour, should address the economic barriers, social inequality, and societal polarisation by adopting a localised product value chain approach. The expression of this approach should also be found in the incentive frameworks of both provincial and local conditional grants as hard conditions to permit procurement of goods only if they are made or assembled locally within the South African borders; to stimulate the domestic economy and inclusive growth and encourage local opportunities while taking international trade agreements into consideration. The economic recovery plan announced by the President in October 2020 largely addresses this recommendation. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 123 The committee appeals to the National Treasury, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and SALGA to continue to support municipalities to resolve the Eskom and water boards debt issue; and to ensure that the matter of provincial and national departments owing municipalities are also expeditiously addressed to bolster municipal finances, as opposed to implementing budget cuts in local government. They should further ensure that municipalities create credible credit control measures, debt management policies and effective revenue collection strategies; and should provide a progress report in this regard during the tabling of the 2021 Budget. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. Managing municipal revenue is a shared responsibility. Government is strengthening national coordination through the single and integrated revenue management framework, which improves collaboration between the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance as they enter a municipality. The framework will assist with planning and budgeting, programme design and implementation. The National Treasury has also placed revenue advisors at each provincial treasury. These advisors will help capacitate the provincial treasuries on revenue initiatives for municipalities and assist municipalities to address inefficiencies in revenue management. The Minister of Finance and Cabinet should take concrete steps to prevent the mismanagement of COVID‐19 funds and to ensure that consequence management is enforced for corruption and malfeasance during personal protective equipment procurement processes. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Health, should table a detailed COVID‐19 expenditure and performance report in Parliament, including how the remaining funds will be appropriated. The Minister of Finance and other Ministers should also ensure that the National Treasury and other departments avail the necessary performance information when requested by oversight and government advisory bodies, such as the FFC, to conduct impact assessments. The National Treasury agrees that this information should be provided when requested for oversight. The National Treasury issued additional requirements in a May 2020 circular to balance the need for flexibility with sufficient internal controls and risk management in responding to COVID‐19. Information on companies that were awarded the personal protective equipment tenders has been published on the National Treasury website. The Ministers of social development and basic education, together with the Minister of Finance, should ensure that proper financial management mechanisms are put in place to prevent wastage and fruitless expenditure of the funds allocated to early childhood development (R496 million) and school sanitation (R475 million); and further explore ways to retain the long term unemployment grant of R350 for unemployed individuals between the ages of 18 and 59. This could provide a safety net for the poorest of the poor, even though it will never be enough to cater for all, considering the current economic situation across South Africa. The National Treasury agrees that the funds should be used efficiently. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting. Given the current economic situation, with declining revenue collection and a rising budget deficit, the committee recommends that government should continue to make use of all legislative measures at its disposal to fight corruption, including recovering monies which have been lost as a result of wrongdoing, whether in state capture, personal protective equipment procurement projects or government officials who contravene public finance management and supply chain management prescripts. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation. While the committee appreciates that COVID‐19 challenges led to the MTBPS being introduced in Parliament a week later, it has meant that the usual tight time frame for processing the bill was",

    "recommendation": "2021 BUDGET REVIEW 124 intensified this year, and the committee and the provincial legislatures would have wanted to give more rigorous attention to the bill. We urge the Minister of Finance to introduce the MTBPS timeously in future. The committee believes that the House Chairpersons of both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces need to look into the possibilities of giving the council more time and space to process the MTBPS in future. The National Treasury notes this concern. While recognising the specific time constraints this year, and other stresses of the National Treasury, the committee believes that the National Treasury’s responses to the concerns of the provincial legislatures were inadequate and recommends that it provide more effective responses in future. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. It responds within its mandate. The committee believes that the reviews of the provincial and local government equitable shares need to be finalised urgently, as it has been on the agenda for a long time and numerous recommendations have repeatedly been made by the committee, SALGA, the FFC and other stakeholders. The matter is now even more urgent, given the impact of COVID‐19 on the provinces and, particularly local government, whose finances are in a perilous state anyway. These reviews need to involve all three spheres of government and other relevant stakeholders, as well as independent technical experts. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance, SALGA and the FFC, is part of a standing technical committee that regularly discusses issues relating to the local government equitable share. In 2013/14, a new local equitable share formula was introduced based on work by committee members. This formula is updated annually through the committee. In December 2020, the Budget Forum agreed that all matters relating to the local government fiscal framework will be managed collaboratively between the National Treasury, the department and SALGA. The National Treasury, provincial treasuries, the FFC, other national departments and independent technical experts are reviewing the provincial equitable share and will publish the results as soon as they are available. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Bill (2020) That the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport provide a report on the possible impact of the R2.8 billion reductions on the provincial roads maintenance grant. Considering the poor state of the provincial road network, the Ministers must provide the committee with alternative viable solutions on how to fund the maintenance of the provincial road network in all the provinces affected by these cuts, the poor provinces in particular. The grant is intended to supplement transfers from the provincial equitable share to fund the maintenance and upgrading of provincial roads. Provinces are expected to fund the construction of new roads from their own budgets. That the Minister of Finance and Minister of Basic Education provide a report on the implications of the R1.9 billion reductions in the education infrastructure grant. The committee views this grant as critical in providing education infrastructure in particular to the previously disadvantaged communities. Each Ministry should report the rationale and implications of the R1.9 billion reductions in this grant given its importance in providing education infrastructure. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considers past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 125 real growth in allocations in recent years. The education infrastructure grant was allocated R35 billion, and grows at an average annual rate of 5.2 per cent over the 2020 MTEF period, including the reductions. While these reductions will delay the delivery of infrastructure projects, all planned projects are still expected to be completed. The Minister of Basic Education should report on the implications of these budget reductions on the education infrastructure grant and provide a list of the affected provinces and the list of the education infrastructure projects affected. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Basic Education. That the Minister of Basic Education provides a comprehensive report on the impact of the R123 million reduction over the MTEF period on the school infrastructure backlogs grant which is meant for the eradication and replacement of inappropriate schools and related school furniture. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Basic Education. That the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Transport, the Minster of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs, SALGA, and the Msunduzi, Buffalo City, and Mbombela municipalities should report on the possible financial and service delivery implications resulting from the R4.3 billion reductions in the public transport network grant over the MTEF period. The aforementioned parties should report to the committee as follows: The Minister of Finance should demonstrate how, over the years, this grant has underperformed in these affected municipalities, what has been the expenditure patterns versus infrastructure investment as required by the grant framework. The Minister should also provide demonstrable evidence that the National Treasury has over time assisted these affected cities without success. In 2019/20, Mbombela, Buffalo City and Msunduzi were suspended from the public transport network grant. This decision was made on the basis of consistent underperformance. Although the grant was initiated in 2006/07, the three cities have not moved past the planning stage of their public transport projects. By the end of 2019/20, about R861 million had been allocated to Buffalo City, R1.7 billion to Mbombela and R1.4 billion to Msunduzi under this grant. To date, the cities have not delivered any public transport services with these funds. The Department of Transport is responsible for administering this grant, therefore it would be best placed to provide data showing spending patterns against infrastructure investment. The National Treasury has supported cities participating in this grant by procuring transport experts to assist the cities with financial planning to ensure their transport systems are fiscally and financially sustainable, and by offering support through relevant experts such as the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer. The Minister of Transport should explain the steps that the department had taken to assist these cities who are currently suspended from the grant. Furthermore, the Minister of Transport should provide a report on the possible implications for the suspension of these cities from the grant in light of what the Department of Transport’s public transport strategy envisages. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Transport. The Minister of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) should clarify the steps that the department implemented over time in order to fast‐track the implementation of this grant and what appears to be the challenges in these cities and how COGTA was assisting these municipalities through available intergovernmental processes. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Cooperative Governance.",

    "recommendation": "19 response, including a social and economic relief package. Accordingly, no significant effect on service delivery is expected as most affected programmes are delayed. The Minister of Finance ensures that the National Treasury provides a comprehensive report on how the National Treasury plans to fund infrastructure spending aimed at reconstruction, rehabilitating and maintaining social and economic infrastructure such as schools, roads and other government infrastructure assets after COVID‐19. The committee is concerned that a lack of a detailed and proper infrastructure recovery plan will lead government to the same path as is currently experienced with Eskom infrastructure maintenance related challenges. This plan should signal the National Treasury’s commitment on funding public infrastructure for reconstruction, maintenance and rehabilitation, while also outlining potential future costs escalations due to delays in funding these key government infrastructure activities and estimated costs overruns of delayed infrastructure projects. This report should be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. The 2020 MTBPS provided a description of the measures to support economic growth, including the funding for infrastructure and the economic development function. In line with the pronouncements made by the President on infrastructure investments for both economic growth stimulation and job creation, the Minister of Finance should ensure that the National Treasury provides a comprehensive report on how this bill responds to the pronouncements made by the President on infrastructure investment. This report should be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. The 2020 MTBPS provided a description of the measures to support economic growth, including the funding for infrastructure and the economic development function. The Minister of Basic Education ensure that the Department of Basic Education submit a detailed report to the committee on the impact of reducing the education infrastructure grant and detailed recovery ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 127 plan for school infrastructure reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance. Given the reports on the number of schools vandalised and destroyed during the lockdown period, the department must also include a detailed list of these schools per province and present a detailed maintenance recovery plan of these schools. This recommendation has been referred to the Minister of Basic Education. That the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs facilitates and ensure engagements between the National Treasury and SALGA so as to resolve the revenue and capacity challenges at the local sphere of government. The committee should be provided with a report on the outcomes of these engagements before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. The National Treasury is implementing this recommendation, as outlined in a previous response above. The Minister of Finance jointly with the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs provide a comprehensive report on how all the municipalities placed under section 139 interventions were monitored and assisted in responding to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Considering that some of these municipalities were showing slow to no signs of improvements, this report must be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2020 MTBPS. The National Treasury will provide this report. On a monthly basis, the National Treasury monitors these municipalities if they have financial recovery plans. This practice continued during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Many municipalities under intervention do not implement their financial recovery plans as required and are advised to do so. Municipalities under intervention were generally unable to quantify the effect of the pandemic on their financial position. In most cases, the effect on municipal revenues tended to be overstated in anticipation of additional financial relief. These municipalities will be assisted through revised financial recovery plans focusing on adjustments to their expenditure. That National Treasury reconsiders the approach of reprioritisation of funds away from the urban settlements development grant in particular and focus more on enhancing the capacity at local government level to effectively, efficiently and economically spend the grant allocations. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Government spends approximately R2.5 billion per year on building capacity in local government and is reviewing the effectiveness of these capacity‐ building programmes. That the relevant Parliamentary portfolio committees should also follow up on issues of poor performance and underspending on key infrastructure grant allocations which have been raised in this report. The National Treasury supports this recommendation. Departments are accountable for spending and performance on grant allocations that they administer. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Second Amendment Bill (2020) In relation to the proposed R1.3 billion reduction in provincial conditional grants allocation to fund the SAA business rescue plan, the Minister of Finance must ensure that the National Treasury provides the committee with an impact assessment report on all provincial conditional grants allocations which were reduced to fund the SAA business rescue plan. The report must highlight the service delivery implications for these proposed grants allocation reduction. The National Treasury looks forward to reporting to the committee at its earliest opportunity.",

In that report, service delivery implications must be highlighted per conditional grant. The committee wants to evaluate the impact of these grants. The committee also wants to evaluate the scientific manner in which these budget reductions were effected. The National Treasury looks forward to reporting to the committee at its earliest opportunity. To manage the effect on services, the amount reduced from each grant considers past spending and performance; whether it funds salaries, medicines and food; and whether there has been significant real growth in allocations in recent years. The Minister of Finance must ensure that the National Treasury provides the committee with a detailed report of all the municipalities whose conditional allocations were reduced to fund the SAA business rescue plan. In that report, the National Treasury must indicate how much each of these affected municipalities owes Eskom for electricity services and the water boards for water. The National Treasury has provided these details. All the reports requested above be submitted to the committee before the tabling of the 2021 Budget to allow the committee sufficient time to analyse the information before the consideration and reporting on the 2021 Budget bills. The National Treasury has provided the information for which it is responsible, and relevant departments have been informed of this request when recommendations were referred.",

It received a transfers of R10.2 billion from NT in the 2020/21 financial year. 6.2.SARS’s annual report for 2020/21 showed that: 6.2.1. Gross revenue amounted to R1 550.3 billion, offset by R300 billion of refunds resulting in a net full year revenue collections R1 249.71 billion. A surplus of R37.50 billion was recorded against the Revised Estimate (RE) (R1 212.2 billion). 6.2.2. Personal Income Tax (PIT), Value Added Tax (VAT) and Company Income Tax (CIT) contributed 82 per cent of the total revenues raised, each contributing 39.1, 26.5 and 16.4 per cent respectively. 6.2.3. PIT full year collections continued to show signs of strain versus the Prior Year (PY) following high unemployment levels. This is despite PAYE growth recovering from a contraction of - 16.0% in June 2020 to -0.02% in March 2021. The required annual growth to reach the RE was -6.7%. The current improvement in the growth is likely to be temporary as payments are boosted by PAYE on retrenchment packages. However, as retrenched employees are removed from the employment base, it is expected that monthly PAYE payments will shrink in the near future. 6.2.4. CIT collections yielded a positive variance of R12.2 billion against the RE. This follows the exceptional performance during the significant collection months of February and March",

    "recommendation": "2021. The stellar performance was on the back of a recent quarterly GDP growth of 6.3% in Q3-2020, following an upward revision of 67.3% in Q3-2020 due to the lag effect and the easing of the lockdown restrictions, with the government allowing more economic activity to resume. 6.2.5. Domestic VAT collections amounted to R392.9 billion, this was R6.4 billion (1.6%) below PY collections of R399.3 billion. The contraction was mainly as a result of significant contractions in April 2020 (-R1.4 billion, -4.3%), May 2020 (-R9.2 billion, -27.9%) and June 2020 (-R4.1 billion, -13.2%). May 2020 collections pertained to the April 2020 tax period, the first full month of the National lockdown, when the country was placed on level 5 restrictions. However, March 2021 collections were strong, reflecting an above inflation growth of R2.8 billion (8.4%) following a much welcomed recovery from the earlier lockdown levels. 6.2.6. Customs collections for the full 2020/21 financial year amounted to R213.9 billion, reflecting a year-on-year (Y/Y) decline of R22.4 billion (9.5%), despite exceeding the RE by R14.0 billion (7.0%). This surplus against RE was underpinned by a record 13th deferment statement total of R15.3 billion, which resulted in March 2021 exceeding the RE by a significant R10.3 billion (44.2%), as well as becoming the fourth month in the last five months of 2020/21 to register a positive Y/Y growth rate (15.7%). Each of the first seven months of 2020/21 registered negative Y/Y growth rates in Customs collections, at an average of -21.8%. 6.2.7. Specific Excise collections started to improve as declaration values reflected signs of recovery. The ban on the sales of alcohol resulted in weakening production and deferred payments. Specific Excise revenue for March 2021 were higher by R6.1 billion than the expected RE. Deferred payments for beer to the amount of R1.4 billion that were approved to be paid in April 2021, were paid earlier in March 2021. 6.2.8. Full year Fuel Levy collections improved as all COVID-19 relief deferment payments were paid in full. Diesel refunds (included in Fuel Levy) were lower compared to the PY. VAT refunds for 2020/21 amounted to R228.2 billion, contracting against the PY by R4.3 billion (1.9%). However, payouts exceeded the 2020/21 RE by R8.0 billion (3.6%). Seven of the 12 months recorded a contraction against the PY, this included months where the country was under hard lockdown restrictions.",

AGSA stated that these material misstatements findings have been reported for at least the past three years and urged that management of the auditees concerned should develop audit action plans that: address the root causes; augment existing capacity; use internal audit units to perform more detailed audits of financial statements; enhance the review process and; where appropriate, implement consequence management by holding officials accountable for these outcomes in order to ensure improvement going forward. 7.16. AGSA stated that there had been an improvement on the quality of performance reporting in the year under review. It said that NT and GPAA had improved and had no material findings reported on the reliability and usefulness of the reported performance information. It acknowledged that this was due to the implementation of the audit action plans to address the prior year performance information control deficiencies. It said that GTAC and CBDA had material findings in this regard due to the inadequate monitoring and reporting of useful and reliable performance information. AGSA urged the management of these entities to implement effective audit action plans to address these repeat findings. 7.17. On financial health, AGSA stated that as of end of March 2021, NT had issued total guarantees of R21 billion to public entities within the finance portfolio. It warned that these guarantees hold potential risks to operating performance and continued service delivery due to the potential negative impact on NT’s ability to fund planned operations, activities, programmes and projects, as funds may need to be diverted away from operating and service delivery objectives in order to fund the guarantees. It explained that NT plays an enabling role in the economic recovery plan of the country and to ensure that other Departments and public sector entities deliver on their mandates and key imperatives of the economic recovery plan. 7.18. It advised that NT needs to ensure that there is adequate oversight over government spending and that the continued government debt is capped to the extent possible and that there are adequate funds available to stimulate the South African economy, which has been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. It further explained that the public sector, in general, continues to struggle to improve their audit outcomes and it urges NT to continue to find ways to support the public sector to ensure that they achieve clean administration and focus on achieving 7",

    "recommendation": "that it would be difficult to propagate these across government, if NT fails to comply with prescripts. The Committee requires NT to submit written update reports to the Committee on the implementation of audit action plans every end of quarter for distribution to members. 8.19. The Committee acknowledges the impressive achievements of SARS under very difficult circumstances. The Committee notes that SARS collected R37.5 billion more than the revised estimate in the year under review. The Committee further notes that this performance has enabled Government to extend the Special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant, which reaches about 9,5 million beneficiaries, provide much welcome relief to the poorest individuals and households in the country until March 2022. 8.20. The Committee notes that while SARS did not achieve a clean audit opinion, there has been some considerable improvement in tackling fruitless and wasteful expenditure and irregular expenditure at SARS. The Committee notes specifically that while irregular expenditure reported in 2018/19 was R356 million, it dropped to R23.6 million in 2019/20 and to R13 million in 2020/21. It also notes that of the R13 million reported in the previous year, only R4.2 million was recorded as a new transaction. On the other hand, fruitless expenditure has dropped to R11 million, where only R2 million of it was recorded as a new transaction. The Committee expects SARS achieve a clean audit in the current financial year. 8.21. The Committee notes that SARS still has a large funding deficit of about R9 billion over 3 years. The Committee notes some assurance from the Deputy Minister of Finance that budgetary processes were being undertaken in order to close this deficit. The Committee recommends that the Minister of Finance considers favourably SARS’s additional financial requirements as this could assist in rebuilding its capacity to serve taxpayers and collect more revenue. 8.22. While noting that some goods seized by SARS from the illicit economy are often harmful and need to be destroyed in order prevent harm, enforce the rule of law and protect jobs, the Committee believes that research needs to be conducted by National Treasury and SARS, working with other relevant state agencies, on how some of the seized non-harmful items could be salvaged and donated to qualifying Non-Government Organisations for distribution to the poor and needy. 8.23. The Committee notes that many submissions on the 2021 Tax Bills in response to the increase in excise duty on tobacco also focussed on fighting the illicit tobacco industry. The Committee notes that SARS has decided to abandon the implementation of the ‘track and trace’ project. The Committee would like to be briefed in more detail on the implementation of measures to fight the illicit economy by NT and SARS. 8.24. The Committee notes with concern that SARS has a very high debt book at R276 billion and recommends that it pays a particular attention to its debt management. 8.25.

    "recommendation": "2022 BUDGET REVIEW 104 This annexure provides responses to the portfolio committees’ recommendations and recommendations from finance committees where they relate to the National Treasury. A number of committees recommended making additional budget allocations available for certain programmes, sub‐programmes or other budget items. Due to the constrained fiscal outlook, there is limited scope to implement these recommendations. However, departments, public entities and other institutions can reprioritise existing funds for new priorities, and in many cases have been able to do so. Portfolio Committee on Employment and Labour The committee demands to receive written monthly progress reports on the engagements between the Department of Employment and Labour and the National Treasury on financial sustainability of the Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE) factories. The department has been advised to resolve the corporate form of the SEE by engaging with the Public Entities Governance Unit in the National Treasury. This may require a new business case, as the business case and implementation plan done in 2012 was not fulfilled. The department will provide monthly reports on these engagements. A preferential procurement framework for government entities is being explored as part of the new Public Procurement Bill, which will aid the SEE factories. Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology The committee noted that with the current funding for ministerial approved programmes at 62 per cent, the department will not be able to meet the enrolment target as per the National Development Plan (NDP). The committee recommends that consideration be made towards progressively injecting additional funds to achieve the 80 per cent funding. The National Treasury acknowledges this recommendation. In light of the limited resources available to government, the Department of Higher Education and Training has had to tailor enrolment funding for the technical and vocational education and training colleges to align it to the funding available. Should the government’s fiscal position improve, the department will be considered for additional resources. The committee recommends additional funding towards the Community Education and Training (CET), especially given the high rate of youth unemployment and the growing number of youths not in education, employment or training. The National Treasury shares the committee’s concern about the high rate of youth unemployment and the need to provide opportunities for young people. At present, enrolment at CET colleges is relatively low because of low demand rather than limited funding. Improving efficiency, including providing more relevant courses, is likely to encourage more young people to enrol at CET colleges. The committee implores the National Treasury to consider additional funding for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) to avert the instability and unfortunate loss of lives experienced at the beginning of the 2021 academic year. Cabinet is engaging with input from the Ministerial Task Team on Student Funding to find a sustainable solution to the increasing demand to provide fee‐free higher education funding. Funding of the current model has been supplemented by an additional allocation of R32.6 billion over the medium term. The committee requests that consideration for additional funding should be made to increase administrative expenditure of the NSFAS as the current administrative budget imposes limitations on the improvements that the Scheme can implement to improve efficiencies, including ICT challenges. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 105 The Department of Higher Education and Training has reprioritised R65 million from savings on unfilled posts in 2021/22. The funds will be used by NSFAS to address its information and communications technology challenges. Further savings may be found by addressing inefficiencies in NSFAS’s current operations. The committee recommends that the National Treasury considers the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) request for additional funding so that the entity can fulfil its mandate and deliver services within the set turnaround times. The Department of Higher Education and Training has reprioritised funding from its baseline to allocate an additional R10.6 million to SAQA over the medium‐term expenditure framework (MTEF) period. Portfolio Committee on Sport, Arts and Culture The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance should prioritise adequate funding and allocation towards the implementation of the White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage over the MTEF period. As noted, there is little scope to provide additional funding at this time. The Department of Sport, Arts and Culture is advised to reprioritise funds in order to implement the White Paper. The department's budget was reduced by R956 million due to COVID‐19 reprioritisation. The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance consider increasing the department's budget for 2022/23 to ensure that the department can fully deliver on its mandate. The department reallocated funds unspent due to COVID‐19 restrictions within its baseline. The 2022/23 baseline is not affected and does not require any upward adjustment. Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities The committee requests the National Treasury to consider the condonation requests by the department and the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE). The National Treasury will consider the condonation requests in line with the irregular expenditure framework when these are submitted by the department and the CGE. The committee requests the National Treasury to consider the requests for roll‐over of funds for the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities and the CGE. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. Requests for rollovers are considered by an internal Treasury committee, guided by Treasury Regulation 6.4. Rollovers that meet the requirements and are approved by the Minister of Finance will be included in the Adjustments Appropriation Bill. The committee requests the National and Provincial Treasuries to provide a detailed report on the funding of the Sanitary Dignity programme (SDP). In 2021/22, R217.3 million was allocated to this programme. Of this amount, R121 million was allocated to provincial departments of education, which implement the programme in five provinces. The remaining R96.3 million was allocated to provincial departments of social development, which implement the programme in the other four provinces. As noted in the 2021 Budget, the relevant provincial departments are best placed to provide more information on funding for these programmes.",

    "recommendation": "2022 BUDGET REVIEW 106 Portfolio Committee on Tourism The National Treasury should work with the Minister of Tourism to determine the budget required to ensure the full recovery of the tourism sector. The National Treasury will continue to engage the Department of Tourism on funding‐related issues during the annual budget process and to support efforts to enable the recovery of the tourism sector. Over the 2022 MTEF period, government has set aside R360 million to support the pilot phase of the Tourism Equity Fund introduced in 2021. Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans The committee notes with concern the Department of Defence’s (DoD) continuous overspending on compensation of employees against the ceiling set by the National Treasury that again resulted in irregular expenditure in 2020/21. This concern requires short‐term and long‐term solutions. The National Treasury should reconsider assisting the DoD with its plans to cut compensation of employees by providing additional funding for an exit mechanism. Furthermore, the National Treasury should indicate to the committee whether it is willing to start funding such a mechanism should the DoD show success in the implementation of its plans to curtail compensation of employees’ expenditure. The National Treasury agrees that the department requires both a short‐ and long‐term plan to manage compensation spending pressures. The department is allocated R1.8 billion over the medium term to implement an exit mechanism that includes employee‐initiated severance packages and early retirement without penalising pension benefits. The committee is aware of the fiscal constraints and noted National Treasury’s previous response to the BRRR [budgetary review and recommendation report] that no funds were available for a ring‐fenced allocation to fund the midlife upgrades of the South African Navy (SA Navy) vessels. However, the committee again recommends that National Treasury reprioritise funds to provide a ring‐fenced allocation to upgrade the SA Navy’s Frigate and Submarine fleet in the coming years. The non‐availability of naval platforms due to maintenance requirements results in the SA Navy not achieving its targets for coastal patrols and sea hours, thus affecting its constitutional mandate to ensure the territorial integrity of South Africa. Additional funding over the medium term for the midlife upgrade is therefore essential. The National Treasury notes the committee’s concern. Given the limited scope to provide additional funding, the National Treasury’s recent engagements with the department have focused on resolving its immediate compensation spending pressures. The reforms described above are expected to generate savings that can be used for other priorities such as the midlife upgrade of the SA Navy vessels. Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services In addition to recommending that zero budget reductions are applied in the case of the National Prosecuting Authority, Legal Aid South Africa, the Special Investigating Unit, the South African Human Rights Commission and the Public Protector South Africa, the committee recommends that additional funding be provided to:  Legal Aid South Africa to establish a Land Rights Management Unit that can provide legal services to poor and vulnerable persons seeking land justice  the Information Regulator for additional capacity  the South African Human Rights Commission to appoint additional monitoring staff; upgrade and replace outdated ICT; and fulfil its coordinating role in respect of the National Preventative Mechanism ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 107 established in terms of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  Public Protector South Africa to fill vacancies, employ subject matter experts for complex investigations, and provide for security and skills development. The baseline budgets for justice‐related institutions are not reduced in the 2022 Budget. Additional funding has been allocated through reprioritisation, as discussed in Chapter 5. Funds will also be transferred to Legal Aid South Africa, in line with current budget processes, to enable the entity to provide the specified legal services upon receipt of a formal request to facilitate such a transfer from the institutions involved. No additional funding is allocated to the Information Regulator, although R105 million was provided in the 2021 Budget to enable it to grow and meet its legislative mandate. Portfolio Committee on Police The committee recommends that the South African Police Service (SAPS) meets with the National Treasury to reopen negotiations on developing the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) as a separate programme within the SAPS and provide a report. The National Treasury has discussed this matter with SAPS and the DPCI, including most recently at a meeting with the DPCI in December 2021. It is not feasible to separate the DPCI from SAPS, mainly because the operational functions of the DPCI are interlinked with the existing Detective Services Programme within SAPS. The South African Police Service Amendment Act (2012), which establishes the DPCI, distinguishes its functions and provides it operational independence from SAPS. For budgeting purposes, however, the DPCI falls within the purpose and definition of the Detective Services Programme. The budget for the DPCI is specifically and exclusively appropriated so that it can only use funds for their intended purpose and, importantly, its budget cannot be changed without Parliament’s approval. Furthermore, as a subprogramme, the performance of the DPCI can be tracked, monitored and reported on separately in SAPS reports. The committee recommends that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) report back on its plans to procure independent technical reports. The committee recommends that the National Treasury considers making funds available to enable this to happen. Although the current fiscal context and constrained budget does not allow for additional funds at this time, the National Treasury has engaged with the IPID on its budget constraints and cost containment measures. The National Treasury also identified inefficiencies and possible savings in information and communication technologies through a spending review. Portfolio Committee on Transport The Minister of Finance, through the National Treasury, should assist the Department of Transport and its entities, along with the Auditor General of South Africa, to obtain a definitive dented interpretation of decision of supply chain management terminology and issues raised with B‐BBEE compliance requirements in order to prevent future disputes during the audit process. Accounting officers and executive authorities are responsible for managing their supply chains. In addition, the National Treasury provides support through toolkits. Departments and entities can leverage the courses and training programmes offered to familiarise themselves with the relevant subject matter and generally accepted definitions and terminologies. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer will continue to publish invitations widely for training that it offers.",

    "recommendation": "2022 BUDGET REVIEW 108 The Minister of Finance through the National Treasury must assist the Department of Transport in finalising a new feasibility study linked to the future of Moloto Rail Corridor and other high‐speed rail corridors. The committee made a similar recommendation in the 2021 Budget. The option of building a new railway line along the Moloto Corridor was explored in a feasibility study undertaken by the Department of Transport in 2015. The National Treasury’s evaluation of the feasibility study concluded that a railway link through the Moloto Corridor route would be unaffordable and unsustainable for both commuters and the fiscus. However, the feasibility study did provide grounds for improvements to the road infrastructure and transport services along the route, which has led to accelerated work on the Moloto development corridor. A more detailed response has also been provided to the Select Committee on Appropriation in its recommendation on the 2019 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill. The Standing Committee on Finance The committee is concerned with the dire situation at the Land Bank, especially since it failed to table its annual report for the 2020/21 financial year as its audit is still outstanding. The committee notes that the situation at the Land Bank has deteriorated after it defaulted on its debt about two years ago. We note further that the Land Bank has not yet finalised the liability solution to address the liquidity challenges and that this poses significant uncertainty regarding its going concern status. The committee urges the Minister of Finance to heighten his oversight and monitoring over the Land Bank in order to ensure that related financial and economic risks associated with it are mitigated. The committee will do an oversight visit to the Land Bank in the next quarter in order to get a detailed presentation on the challenges it faces, together with its insurance companies. The Land Bank has made progress in addressing its financial challenges, which is reflected in an improvement in its 2020/21 audit relative to its 2019/20 audit outcomes. Chapter 8 provides more detail on these developments. The committee notes that the South African Revenue Service (SARS) still has a large funding deficit of about R9 billion over three years. The committee notes some assurance from the Deputy Minister of Finance that budgetary processes were being undertaken in order to close this deficit. The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance considers favourably SARS’s additional financial requirements as this could assist in rebuilding its capacity to serve taxpayers and collect more revenue. Government is experiencing fiscal constraints and reprioritisation is the main policy tool for making funding available. Over the 2021 MTEF period, R3 billion was allocated to SARS to support capacity‐ building initiatives. The National Treasury will continue to engage SARS on its funding challenges in light of the importance of its work. Recommendations of the Standing and Select Committee on Finance on the",

    "recommendation": "2022 Budget allocates additional amounts of R6.2 billion in 2023/24 and R8.5 billion in 2024/25 to ensure that social grants rise in line with inflation over the MTEF period. In addition, R44 billion is allocated to extend the special COVID‐19 social relief of distress grant for 12 months until March 2023. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 109 In the 2021 Fiscal Framework Report of the Committee, we stated that “in view of the COVID‐19 related job losses, increasing poverty and inequality, the NT and the government should seriously consider a basic income grant after the necessary consultations with the relevant stakeholders”. The Committee expects to hear concrete announcements on this when the Minister delivers the 2022 Budget in February. The COVID‐19 pandemic increased national debate on the possibility of a universal basic income grant and government is considering various proposals in this regard. It is essential to maintain social protection in a sustainable way. As discussed in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3, any proposals to expand this system need to be fully and appropriately financed by closing existing programmes to free up revenue, or through permanent increases in revenue collection. The committee notes comments from some stakeholders that the risk statement in the 2021 MTBPS may be narrow, leaving out a number of other real risks such as the recurrence of social unrest and inadequate contingency reserves. The committee recommends that the National Treasury takes note of these concerns and seek to broaden its risk identification and analysis so that adequate mitigation measures can be catered for in the fiscal framework. The National Treasury welcomes the proposal and will continue to assess risks as they arise. The fiscal risk statement (Annexure A in the MTBPS) focuses on medium‐ and longer‐term risks to the public finances. Short‐term risks are discussed in Chapter 3 of the MTBPS. Government faces a range of fiscal risks over the medium to longer term. Major risks identified in the 2021 MTBPS include, but are not limited to, the durability of the economic recovery, litigation relating to public‐service compensation, future wage negotiations and the financial state of several state‐owned companies and municipalities. The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance reports quarterly on the effectiveness of the National Treasury’s debt management strategies that would ensure that the level of debt stabilises over the medium term and avoids a sovereign debt crisis. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and will provide quarterly reports. It publishes a public debt management report every year. The committee recommends that the Public Procurement Bill be brought to Parliament and the processing of Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act be acted on with urgency. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The draft Public Procurement Bill was gazetted for public comment in February 2020. The revised bill needs to be approved by the Minister of Finance, submitted to the National Economic Development and Labour Council for consultation, and then approved by Cabinet before its introduction in Parliament. The National Treasury is processing public comments on the second draft of Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act (1956) and will submit a final version to the Minister of Finance for gazetting shortly. The committee notes that the Financial Action Task Force’s Mutual Evaluation Report found gaps in the implementation of South Africa’s anti‐money laundering and terrorist financing measures. The committee requests a briefing on this report by the National Treasury and the Financial Intelligence Centre. The National Treasury will present a report to Parliament on the Financial Action Task Force’s Mutual Evaluation Report and introduce urgent legislation aimed at addressing shortcomings identified in the mutual evaluation.",

The committee wants to understand why there are delays in the implementation of this project and the remedial action taken to correct this problem. This will assist the committee to avoid recommending the appropriation of funds that will not be spent and possible future reductions of this grant. The recommendation has been referred to the Department of Transport. The National Treasury notes that the public transport network grant for the City of Cape Town was reduced to align it with the City’s revised implementation plan for MyCiTi phase 2A. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill That the Minister of Basic Education ensures that the Department of Basic Education provides a detailed report on the planning and framework used by various schools while using the R6 billion allocation for the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative to fund the employment of education assistants and general school assistants at public ordinary schools and public special schools. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Basic Education. That the Minister of Basic Education ensures that the Department of Basic Education (DBE) provides Parliament with a detailed plan and timeframes on how the department plans to ensure that all schools have access to decent water and sanitation by the end of 2022 as part of the Sanitation Appropriate for Education initiative. Furthermore, the DBE must provide a detailed list of all the schools that have inappropriate water and sanitation per province and regions, as well as the plan as to when each of these schools’ water and sanitation needs will be addressed. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Basic Education. That the Minister of Social Development ensures that the Department of Social Development (DSD) provides a comprehensive report to Parliament on the policy around the funding and subsequent deployment of social work graduates who are beneficiaries of the government bursary scheme. Furthermore, the DSD must provide a comprehensive expenditure report on the numbers of social workers that were funded through the government bursary scheme over the last five financial years, the total amount spent, and the number of those graduates who were placed to work areas by the department. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Social Development. On the proposed allocation reduction of R1.3 billion on the public transport network grant for the City of Cape Town, the Minister of Transport and the City of Cape Town provides a detailed report to Parliament on the reasons and implications for the delays in implementing the MyCiTi phase 2A. The committee wants ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 111 to understand why there are delays in the implementation of this project and the remedial action taken to correct this problem. This will assist the committee to avoid recommending the appropriation of funds that will not be spent and possible future reductions of this grant.

Furthermore, the Minister is requested to ensure that the DoH provide the committee with a progress report on both the Limpopo Academic and Klipfontein hospitals. The DoH must provide a report on the possible service delivery implications of the proposed reduction of funds to these projects. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Health. That the Minister of Finance ensures that the funds allocated towards the Presidential Youth Initiatives are spent within the required guidelines and frameworks in order to avoid potential abuse and corruption. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting. Moreover, funding was provided for projects that were ready for implementation, based on the strength of the application submitted. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Adjustments Appropriation Bill The National Treasury should ensure that any movement of funds is always done according to the provisions of the Public Finance Management Act (1999) and Treasury Regulations. The committee does not support any movement of funds emanating from poor planning and performance by government departments. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation. Virements and shifting of funds are always carried out in line with the relevant legislation and regulations, including those cited by the committee. The National Treasury should approve the rollover amount of R2.8 billion in line with the Public Finance Management Act and Treasury Regulations for projects that have already been committed or nearing completion. However, the rolling over of funds due to poor project management, planning and execution cannot be allowed. The National Treasury notes the recommendation by the committee. Requests for rollovers are always considered within the parameters set by Treasury Regulation 6.4. The National Treasury and the Department of Social Development should consider extending the R350 temporary special COVID‐19 social relief of distress grant beyond March 2022, considering budgetary constraints and depending on the COVID‐19 impact and economic recovery plans.",

    "recommendation": "25 per cent package cut for members of the Cabinet, provincial executive and mayoral committees, as well as executive managers in the state, entities, state‐owned entities and metropolitan municipalities. The National Treasury agrees that remuneration packages in state‐owned companies need to be better aligned with the public‐service remuneration framework. Nevertheless, this would require legislative changes for certain state‐owned companies, as remuneration in state‐owned companies is governed by their boards. Remuneration matters relating to public office bearers are governed by the Independent Commission for The Remuneration of Public Office‐Bearers. The National Treasury’s role is to advise on proposed recommendations, in light of the macroeconomic and fiscal position of the country. The committee notes COSATU’s recommendation that government should consider reversing budget cuts to key programmes that will impact on its ability to implement industrial, manufacturing and export programmes to improve economic growth. As noted, the fiscal outlook is highly constrained at this time. If fiscal constraints ease, priority programmes may be considered for additional funding. The committee has long supported gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming; and further stresses the importance of recognising the rights, needs and interests of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, and asexual or ally (LGBTQIA+) community and requests the National Treasury to, in future, explicitly set out what cross‐cutting funding furthers these. The National Treasury and Cabinet should look into these matters very closely and the committee will monitor this. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and will update the committee as its work develops. It is working with other stakeholders to implement gender‐responsive budgeting across government. This is expected to roll out in the 2023 MTEF process. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill The National Treasury and Cabinet should take into consideration the existing capacity of the officials and institutions to properly spend additional funds when allocations are made to various provinces and municipalities. The situation where poor planning and lack of capacity to implement projects result in poor spending, unnecessary rollovers and deviations, cannot be allowed to continue. The relevant Minister must further ensure that the implementation of consequence management is fast‐tracked and, where necessary, law enforcement agencies are brought on board to recover any financial losses to the state and hold the implicated officials or politicians accountable. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Sector departments facilitate the process of determining the allocations for provinces and municipalities for conditional grants. This process includes developing mechanisms to assess the plans that provinces and municipalities submit and to provide guidance on the implementation of these plans. The conditional grant frameworks also include details on compliance requirements for conditional grant allocations. For funds to be rolled over, sector departments, provinces and municipalities need to comply with predetermined criteria, including an assessment of spending capacity. While the committee welcomes the increased allocation for local government over the medium‐term period, the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 together with their provincial counterparts and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA), need to work together to ensure that suitably qualified and experienced individuals are appointed to improve financial management capacity and service delivery in local government. Municipalities are responsible for appointing their employees. The National Treasury has shared minimum requirements for appointments in certain positions in municipalities. The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (DCoG), together with their provincial counterparts, should ensure that concerns raised by SALGA around the correctness of assumptions about collection of own revenue, contained in the 1998 Local Government White Paper, are addressed urgently. This issue was discussed extensively in the 2020 and 2021 Budget Forum lekgotla. SALGA, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, the National Treasury and the Financial and Fiscal Commission are implementing the resolutions and tracking quarterly progress. A Budget Forum session is expected to provide feedback around March 2022. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) needs to work with SALGA to fast‐track the implementation of the resolution around unfunded mandates, which was taken during the Local Government Budget Lekgotla in December 2020 and further ensure that funds always follow function. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to CoGTA and SALGA. A Budget Forum session is expected to provide feedback around March 2022. The provincial departments of cooperative governance and provincial treasuries should work with SALGA to ensure that proper interventions and systems to monitor service delivery in local government are implemented to address the issues around water losses and electricity challenges. Moreover, the committee is of the view that the provincial executives of both finance and cooperative governance need to again work with SALGA to enforce consequence management in relation to negative performance reports, failure to submit financial statements, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure using the monthly and quarterly reports they receive. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the provincial departments of cooperative governance and treasuries. The National Treasury should be proactive in ascertaining which provinces will not spend their housing budgets to ensure appropriate remedial actions are taken immediately, including the transfer of the funds to better performing provinces, and avoid last‐minute gazettes, fruitless and wasteful expenditure and fiscal dumping towards the end of the financial year. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Departments are responsible for administering and monitoring performance within the conditional grants. The National Treasury supports departments through the implementation of the Division of Revenue Act. In terms of this act, any reallocation of funds in terms of section 19(1) requires transferring departments to consider whether the reallocated amounts will be spent within the same financial year. The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should ensure that challenges around delays and poor contracting, which led to the roll‐over amount of R582 million for the Vaal River Pollution Remediation Project in Emfuleni local municipality, are addressed and the work verification process is completed for invoices to be paid as required. Otherwise, such delays will have a negative impact on the project completion timelines, service providers’ cash flows and the livelihoods of their employees.",

    "recommendation": "2022 BUDGET REVIEW 114 The National Treasury will engage the Department of Water and Sanitation on how this project can be fast‐tracked. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, together with its provincial counterparts, should fast‐track the implementation of the district development model to ensure systems are in place for more integrated delivery of services and ensure sufficient capacity, by driving coordination and alignment of processes, which have been a challenge in the local government sphere for many years. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The Department of Basic Education, together with provincial education departments, should ensure that the lack of parity between provinces regarding the stipend paid to early childhood development workers is urgently addressed, once the function shift from the Department of Social Development has been completed. COSATU and other federations should work with government to address this. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Basic Education. The National Treasury and the Department of Transport, together with their provincial counterparts, should make sure that allocations earmarked for the provincial roads maintenance grant are utilised effectively, according to the grant framework, to address the poor state of some provincial roads, which negatively affects economic activities. The quality of material used, workmanship and procurement processes for such projects need to improve in order to realise value for money. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Transport. The two departments are developing criteria for allocating grant funding earmarked for performance incentives. With regard to hospital infrastructure maintenance, the National Treasury and the Department of Health, together with their provincial counterparts, should ensure that more resources are earmarked to deal with the current poor state of some hospital infrastructure, which requires proper maintenance in various provinces, especially given the advent of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Furthermore, the quality of workmanship and material and procurement processes for such projects need to improve to achieve value for money. Government provides substantial funding for this purpose, including through the health facility revitalisation grant. This conditional grant, which was allocated R21.3 billion over the 2022 MTEF period, is transferred to provinces for the construction and maintenance of health infrastructure. In addition, provincial departments of health fund infrastructure maintenance through their own budgets. At present, there is limited scope for additional fiscal resources. The recommendation has also been referred to the Department of Health. The Department of Water and Sanitation, together with the Western Cape Provincial Treasury, should ensure that the implementation of the potable water security and remedial works project is expedited in the George Local Municipality and the allocated funds are spent according to the framework of the regional bulk infrastructure grant to ensure improved access to clean, drinkable water for all. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Department of Water and Sanitation, the Western Cape Provincial Treasury and the National Treasury will monitor performance in this municipality through the monthly and quarterly performance reports required by the Division of Revenue Act. The National Treasury and the Department of Basic Education should ensure that the rollover amount of R210 million for the school infrastructure backlogs grant to complete projects that are part of the Sanitation Appropriate for Education initiative is properly spent to expedite the replacement and removal ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 115 of inappropriate and unsuitable sanitation in certain provinces. The committee is of the view that the pace at which this initiative is implemented, is unacceptably slow given that this programme started in 2010. The department should expand the programme to include the eradication of asbestos schools in certain provinces, if not already included. The National Treasury has referred the recommendation to the Department of Basic Education and will continue to monitor the monthly spending in line with its oversight role. The National Treasury and Department of Public Service and Administration, together with provincial treasuries, should ensure the effective implementation of the wage agreement of the Public Service Co‐ ordinating Bargaining Council for the 2021/22 financial year for public‐sector workers, according to the agreed terms. This should bring the much‐needed certainty and stability in the public service to ensure uninterrupted service delivery to the poor and vulnerable. Furthermore, government needs to ensure that funded vacant posts are filled urgently. COSATU and other federations should work with government to ensure progress in this regard. Additional funds have been allocated to provincial transfers for provinces to pay the cash gratuity for public‐service employees resulting from the 2021 wage agreement. The National Treasury has also referred the recommendation to the Department of Public Service and Administration. The headcount cuts for the South African Police Service and teachers need to be reversed in order to protect frontline service delivery. The committee is of the view that the headcount cuts should happen at the management level of each department as opposed to the levels at which services are being delivered. Government’s fiscal consolidation strategy requires departments to contain expenditure on employee compensation. The National Treasury has encouraged departments to protect frontline services to the degree possible, but management of personnel numbers and compensation spending are departmental prerogatives. The 2022 Budget provides additional funding for the police, education and health sectors over the next three years to address some of these challenges. The National Treasury and Cabinet need to ensure that concrete steps are taken to monitor the impact of the well‐funded employment creation programmes, such as the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative, to achieve value for money and avoid mistakes that might have occurred in similar programmes in the past. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting so that it can monitor impact, along with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Second Special Appropriation Bill The Minister of Finance should ensure that the South African Special Risk Insurance Association (SASRIA) SOC Ltd expedites the process of verifying and validating additional claims, as well as sharing its revenue model with government and employing clear measures to cover for all additional claims and to address any possible negative impact on its solvency ratio.

The National Treasury notes the recommendation and will continue to engage the departments on the issues noted by the committee in future budget processes. The relevant allocations were specifically to provide for unforeseen costs resulting from public violence in July 2021 and for the deployment of the SANDF in Mozambique. The National Treasury and the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, together with the Department of Small Business Development, should reconsider and address rigid bureaucratic processes for small, medium and micro enterprises to access government support relief funds and develop adequate communication mechanisms to ensure that all businesses in townships and rural areas, which were affected by the unrest, are part of the government relief support. The National Treasury evaluates programmes, recommends funding and, if funding is approved, monitors expenditure and performance. Departments are responsible for designing and administering their programmes, including ensuring they meet their objectives. The recommendation has also been referred to the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition and the Department of Small Business Development. The Minister of Finance, together with the Ministers of Social Development; Trade, Industry and Competition; Police; and Defence, should ensure that all additional funds earmarked for their respective departments are spent according to the approved departmental plans and within the ambit of the Second Special Appropriation Act (2021); and further ensure that clear internal controls and financial management systems are put in place to prevent poor performance and wasteful and fruitless expenditure, and that consequence management is enforced and implemented, where necessary, to deal with issues of financial misconduct and corruption. The National Treasury agrees with the committee’s recommendation and will continue to monitor the use of the allocated funds as part of its spending oversight of departments. Under the Public Financial Management Act, accounting officers of departments are responsible for preventing unauthorised, irregular and fruitless and wasteful expenditure, as well as losses resulting from criminal conduct. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and conditional grant allocations to provinces and municipalities as contained in the 2021 MTBPS While noting the impact of COVID‐19 on the economy, the committee is of the view that the National Treasury and Cabinet should outline and continue to intensify efforts to develop policies, interventions and measures to grow the economy in the 2022 Budget, to avoid a situation where transfers to provinces and municipalities continue to grow below inflation. This will also assist in better managing the escalating cost of government debt, which negatively affects resources to deliver basic services to the poor and vulnerable. The National Treasury agrees that policies should aim to raise economic growth to increase fiscal resources and help manage escalating debt. The 2022 Budget is aimed at achieving these objectives. As noted, the fiscal position is highly constrained, affecting the rate at which transfers to provinces and municipalities grow. While welcoming the annual update of the provincial equitable share (PES) formula to ensure fair funding allocations to each province, the committee urges the National Treasury and the Department of Health to expedite the process of phasing in the changes to the health component between the 2022/23 and 2024/25 financial years, which accounts for 27 per cent of the formula. In addition, the National Treasury, ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 together with provincial treasuries, should ensure that monitoring systems and controls are put in place to achieve effective and efficient spending of the PES. Changes to the health component as a result of the new risk adjustment index will be phased in over the",

    "recommendation": "2022 MTEF period to help provinces adapt to the resulting changes in their equitable share allocations. The National Treasury, alongside provincial treasuries, will continue to monitor spending of the provincial equitable share in line with its oversight role. While the introduction of various components into the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant over the years is welcomed, the National Treasury and Department of Health should ensure that this conditional grant expenditure is improved and implemented according to the division of revenue framework. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. From the 2022 MTEF period, the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant will be restructured to address concerns over its spending and management arising from the introduction of various new components. The restructured grant, the district health programmes grant, will have two components: the comprehensive HIV/AIDS component and the district health component. The components that were created for mental health services and oncology services will be shifted to the direct national health insurance grant. Spending and management of conditional grants are monitored by relevant national departments and the National Treasury in line with the Division of Revenue Act. While the committee welcomes the shifting of the mental health and oncology components introduced in the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant in the 2021 MTEF to the direct national health insurance grant for provinces; the National Treasury and the Department of Health need to make sure that sound financial management and procurement processes are strengthened for provincial health departments to avoid wastage. The National Treasury should report on this matter during the next budget process. This recommendation is noted. The components that were created for mental health services and oncology services will be shifted to the direct national health insurance grant, now that provinces have demonstrated their readiness to take over the functions. The shifted funds will follow the financial management and procurement process of the grant recipient, which is monitored by the national Department of Health to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Division of Revenue Act and avoid wastage. The Department of Basic Education, together with provincial education departments, should ensure that the lack of parity between provinces regarding the stipend paid to early childhood development workers is urgently addressed once the function shift from the Department of Social Development has been completed.

The Department of Transport monitors provincial compliance in the provincial road maintenance grant. Measures to address non‐compliance include withholding transfers. While the committee welcomes the expansion of scope for the municipal infrastructure grant (MIG) to help municipalities to improve their asset management practices; the committee urges the Department of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs to fast‐track the process of identifying municipalities that require such intervention for funds to be earmarked in the 2022/23 financial year. The National Treasury must report on this during the next budget process. The National Treasury acknowledges the urgency of finalising this process. The Department of Cooperative Governance expects to identify these municipalities by end‐February 2022, at which point it will notify them and discuss entering into a memorandum of understanding. The implementation plan for municipalities is expected to be finalised by April 2022. While the committee welcomes the increased allocation for local government over the medium‐term period, the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, together with their provincial counterparts and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA), need to work together to ensure that suitably qualified and experienced individuals are appointed in finance units at municipalities. The committee is of the view that building the required in‐house capacity is paramount for any stable government and therefore the amount of R1 billion reportedly spent on consultants to compile municipal financial reports is highly unacceptable, especially when municipal finance management units have been established in the provincial treasuries to also assist. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. It will work with provincial treasuries to strengthen the capacity of municipal officials in financial management units through the local government financial management grant. The National Treasury, together with Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, should ensure that institutional problems at local government are adequately diagnosed before solutions are developed and the current fragmented capacity‐building programmes are reviewed and tailored to respond to specific capacity challenges affecting local government finances. They should also ensure that municipal finance management units are strengthened and accountability is enforced, both politically and administratively, to ensure consequence management for transgressors. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation, which aligns with the findings from its recent review of the capacity‐building system for local government. Chapter 6 provides more detail on the review and steps that will follow. The Committee notes with concern the growing trend of allocating indirect grants which creates a false narrative of increased allocations to local government when in fact these are merely national department projects being rolled out at local level; and therefore wishes to emphasise the importance of the three spheres of government and the important distinctions between the spheres. The lack of capacity at certain municipalities to spend should not disadvantage those municipalities that are able to spend their direct conditional grants. In addition, the administering department should ensure that municipalities who are unable to spend, are capacitated to perform better. The National Treasury notes these concerns. The National Treasury is in discussions with departments on possible reforms to creating new indirect grants and changes to some of the management rules given the insufficient enforcement measures within the Division of Revenue Act.",

    "recommendation": "25 per cent package cut for members of the Cabinet, provincial executive and mayoral committees, as well as executive managers in the state, entities, state‐owned entities and metropolitan municipalities. The National Treasury agrees that remuneration packages in state‐owned companies need to be better aligned with the public‐service remuneration framework. Nevertheless, this would require legislative changes for certain state‐owned companies, as remuneration in state‐owned companies is governed by their boards. Remuneration matters relating to public office bearers are governed by the Independent Commission for The Remuneration of Public Office‐Bearers. The National Treasury’s role is to advise on proposed recommendations, in light of the macroeconomic and fiscal position of the country. The committee notes COSATU’s recommendation that government should consider reversing budget cuts to key programmes that will impact on its ability to implement industrial, manufacturing and export programmes to improve economic growth. As noted, the fiscal outlook is highly constrained at this time. If fiscal constraints ease, priority programmes may be considered for additional funding. The committee has long supported gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming; and further stresses the importance of recognising the rights, needs and interests of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, and asexual or ally (LGBTQIA+) community and requests the National Treasury to, in future, explicitly set out what cross‐cutting funding furthers these. The National Treasury and Cabinet should look into these matters very closely and the committee will monitor this. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and will update the committee as its work develops. It is working with other stakeholders to implement gender‐responsive budgeting across government. This is expected to roll out in the 2023 MTEF process. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill The National Treasury and Cabinet should take into consideration the existing capacity of the officials and institutions to properly spend additional funds when allocations are made to various provinces and municipalities. The situation where poor planning and lack of capacity to implement projects result in poor spending, unnecessary rollovers and deviations, cannot be allowed to continue. The relevant Minister must further ensure that the implementation of consequence management is fast‐tracked and, where necessary, law enforcement agencies are brought on board to recover any financial losses to the state and hold the implicated officials or politicians accountable. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Sector departments facilitate the process of determining the allocations for provinces and municipalities for conditional grants. This process includes developing mechanisms to assess the plans that provinces and municipalities submit and to provide guidance on the implementation of these plans. The conditional grant frameworks also include details on compliance requirements for conditional grant allocations. For funds to be rolled over, sector departments, provinces and municipalities need to comply with predetermined criteria, including an assessment of spending capacity. While the committee welcomes the increased allocation for local government over the medium‐term period, the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 together with their provincial counterparts and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA), need to work together to ensure that suitably qualified and experienced individuals are appointed to improve financial management capacity and service delivery in local government. Municipalities are responsible for appointing their employees. The National Treasury has shared minimum requirements for appointments in certain positions in municipalities. The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (DCoG), together with their provincial counterparts, should ensure that concerns raised by SALGA around the correctness of assumptions about collection of own revenue, contained in the 1998 Local Government White Paper, are addressed urgently. This issue was discussed extensively in the 2020 and 2021 Budget Forum lekgotla. SALGA, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, the National Treasury and the Financial and Fiscal Commission are implementing the resolutions and tracking quarterly progress. A Budget Forum session is expected to provide feedback around March 2022. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) needs to work with SALGA to fast‐track the implementation of the resolution around unfunded mandates, which was taken during the Local Government Budget Lekgotla in December 2020 and further ensure that funds always follow function. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to CoGTA and SALGA. A Budget Forum session is expected to provide feedback around March 2022. The provincial departments of cooperative governance and provincial treasuries should work with SALGA to ensure that proper interventions and systems to monitor service delivery in local government are implemented to address the issues around water losses and electricity challenges. Moreover, the committee is of the view that the provincial executives of both finance and cooperative governance need to again work with SALGA to enforce consequence management in relation to negative performance reports, failure to submit financial statements, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure using the monthly and quarterly reports they receive. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the provincial departments of cooperative governance and treasuries. The National Treasury should be proactive in ascertaining which provinces will not spend their housing budgets to ensure appropriate remedial actions are taken immediately, including the transfer of the funds to better performing provinces, and avoid last‐minute gazettes, fruitless and wasteful expenditure and fiscal dumping towards the end of the financial year. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Departments are responsible for administering and monitoring performance within the conditional grants. The National Treasury supports departments through the implementation of the Division of Revenue Act. In terms of this act, any reallocation of funds in terms of section 19(1) requires transferring departments to consider whether the reallocated amounts will be spent within the same financial year. The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should ensure that challenges around delays and poor contracting, which led to the roll‐over amount of R582 million for the Vaal River Pollution Remediation Project in Emfuleni local municipality, are addressed and the work verification process is completed for invoices to be paid as required. Otherwise, such delays will have a negative impact on the project completion timelines, service providers’ cash flows and the livelihoods of their employees.",

    "recommendation": "2022 BUDGET REVIEW 114 The National Treasury will engage the Department of Water and Sanitation on how this project can be fast‐tracked. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, together with its provincial counterparts, should fast‐track the implementation of the district development model to ensure systems are in place for more integrated delivery of services and ensure sufficient capacity, by driving coordination and alignment of processes, which have been a challenge in the local government sphere for many years. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The Department of Basic Education, together with provincial education departments, should ensure that the lack of parity between provinces regarding the stipend paid to early childhood development workers is urgently addressed, once the function shift from the Department of Social Development has been completed. COSATU and other federations should work with government to address this. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Basic Education. The National Treasury and the Department of Transport, together with their provincial counterparts, should make sure that allocations earmarked for the provincial roads maintenance grant are utilised effectively, according to the grant framework, to address the poor state of some provincial roads, which negatively affects economic activities. The quality of material used, workmanship and procurement processes for such projects need to improve in order to realise value for money. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Transport. The two departments are developing criteria for allocating grant funding earmarked for performance incentives. With regard to hospital infrastructure maintenance, the National Treasury and the Department of Health, together with their provincial counterparts, should ensure that more resources are earmarked to deal with the current poor state of some hospital infrastructure, which requires proper maintenance in various provinces, especially given the advent of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Furthermore, the quality of workmanship and material and procurement processes for such projects need to improve to achieve value for money. Government provides substantial funding for this purpose, including through the health facility revitalisation grant. This conditional grant, which was allocated R21.3 billion over the 2022 MTEF period, is transferred to provinces for the construction and maintenance of health infrastructure. In addition, provincial departments of health fund infrastructure maintenance through their own budgets. At present, there is limited scope for additional fiscal resources. The recommendation has also been referred to the Department of Health. The Department of Water and Sanitation, together with the Western Cape Provincial Treasury, should ensure that the implementation of the potable water security and remedial works project is expedited in the George Local Municipality and the allocated funds are spent according to the framework of the regional bulk infrastructure grant to ensure improved access to clean, drinkable water for all. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Department of Water and Sanitation, the Western Cape Provincial Treasury and the National Treasury will monitor performance in this municipality through the monthly and quarterly performance reports required by the Division of Revenue Act. The National Treasury and the Department of Basic Education should ensure that the rollover amount of R210 million for the school infrastructure backlogs grant to complete projects that are part of the Sanitation Appropriate for Education initiative is properly spent to expedite the replacement and removal ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 115 of inappropriate and unsuitable sanitation in certain provinces. The committee is of the view that the pace at which this initiative is implemented, is unacceptably slow given that this programme started in 2010. The department should expand the programme to include the eradication of asbestos schools in certain provinces, if not already included. The National Treasury has referred the recommendation to the Department of Basic Education and will continue to monitor the monthly spending in line with its oversight role. The National Treasury and Department of Public Service and Administration, together with provincial treasuries, should ensure the effective implementation of the wage agreement of the Public Service Co‐ ordinating Bargaining Council for the 2021/22 financial year for public‐sector workers, according to the agreed terms. This should bring the much‐needed certainty and stability in the public service to ensure uninterrupted service delivery to the poor and vulnerable. Furthermore, government needs to ensure that funded vacant posts are filled urgently. COSATU and other federations should work with government to ensure progress in this regard. Additional funds have been allocated to provincial transfers for provinces to pay the cash gratuity for public‐service employees resulting from the 2021 wage agreement. The National Treasury has also referred the recommendation to the Department of Public Service and Administration. The headcount cuts for the South African Police Service and teachers need to be reversed in order to protect frontline service delivery. The committee is of the view that the headcount cuts should happen at the management level of each department as opposed to the levels at which services are being delivered. Government’s fiscal consolidation strategy requires departments to contain expenditure on employee compensation. The National Treasury has encouraged departments to protect frontline services to the degree possible, but management of personnel numbers and compensation spending are departmental prerogatives. The 2022 Budget provides additional funding for the police, education and health sectors over the next three years to address some of these challenges. The National Treasury and Cabinet need to ensure that concrete steps are taken to monitor the impact of the well‐funded employment creation programmes, such as the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative, to achieve value for money and avoid mistakes that might have occurred in similar programmes in the past. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting so that it can monitor impact, along with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Second Special Appropriation Bill The Minister of Finance should ensure that the South African Special Risk Insurance Association (SASRIA) SOC Ltd expedites the process of verifying and validating additional claims, as well as sharing its revenue model with government and employing clear measures to cover for all additional claims and to address any possible negative impact on its solvency ratio.

The National Treasury notes the recommendation and will continue to engage the departments on the issues noted by the committee in future budget processes. The relevant allocations were specifically to provide for unforeseen costs resulting from public violence in July 2021 and for the deployment of the SANDF in Mozambique. The National Treasury and the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, together with the Department of Small Business Development, should reconsider and address rigid bureaucratic processes for small, medium and micro enterprises to access government support relief funds and develop adequate communication mechanisms to ensure that all businesses in townships and rural areas, which were affected by the unrest, are part of the government relief support. The National Treasury evaluates programmes, recommends funding and, if funding is approved, monitors expenditure and performance. Departments are responsible for designing and administering their programmes, including ensuring they meet their objectives. The recommendation has also been referred to the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition and the Department of Small Business Development. The Minister of Finance, together with the Ministers of Social Development; Trade, Industry and Competition; Police; and Defence, should ensure that all additional funds earmarked for their respective departments are spent according to the approved departmental plans and within the ambit of the Second Special Appropriation Act (2021); and further ensure that clear internal controls and financial management systems are put in place to prevent poor performance and wasteful and fruitless expenditure, and that consequence management is enforced and implemented, where necessary, to deal with issues of financial misconduct and corruption. The National Treasury agrees with the committee’s recommendation and will continue to monitor the use of the allocated funds as part of its spending oversight of departments. Under the Public Financial Management Act, accounting officers of departments are responsible for preventing unauthorised, irregular and fruitless and wasteful expenditure, as well as losses resulting from criminal conduct. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and conditional grant allocations to provinces and municipalities as contained in the 2021 MTBPS While noting the impact of COVID‐19 on the economy, the committee is of the view that the National Treasury and Cabinet should outline and continue to intensify efforts to develop policies, interventions and measures to grow the economy in the 2022 Budget, to avoid a situation where transfers to provinces and municipalities continue to grow below inflation. This will also assist in better managing the escalating cost of government debt, which negatively affects resources to deliver basic services to the poor and vulnerable. The National Treasury agrees that policies should aim to raise economic growth to increase fiscal resources and help manage escalating debt. The 2022 Budget is aimed at achieving these objectives. As noted, the fiscal position is highly constrained, affecting the rate at which transfers to provinces and municipalities grow. While welcoming the annual update of the provincial equitable share (PES) formula to ensure fair funding allocations to each province, the committee urges the National Treasury and the Department of Health to expedite the process of phasing in the changes to the health component between the 2022/23 and 2024/25 financial years, which accounts for 27 per cent of the formula. In addition, the National Treasury, ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 together with provincial treasuries, should ensure that monitoring systems and controls are put in place to achieve effective and efficient spending of the PES.

The National Treasury, alongside provincial treasuries, will continue to monitor spending of the provincial equitable share in line with its oversight role. While the introduction of various components into the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant over the years is welcomed, the National Treasury and Department of Health should ensure that this conditional grant expenditure is improved and implemented according to the division of revenue framework. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. From the 2022 MTEF period, the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant will be restructured to address concerns over its spending and management arising from the introduction of various new components. The restructured grant, the district health programmes grant, will have two components: the comprehensive HIV/AIDS component and the district health component. The components that were created for mental health services and oncology services will be shifted to the direct national health insurance grant. Spending and management of conditional grants are monitored by relevant national departments and the National Treasury in line with the Division of Revenue Act. While the committee welcomes the shifting of the mental health and oncology components introduced in the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant in the 2021 MTEF to the direct national health insurance grant for provinces; the National Treasury and the Department of Health need to make sure that sound financial management and procurement processes are strengthened for provincial health departments to avoid wastage. The National Treasury should report on this matter during the next budget process. This recommendation is noted. The components that were created for mental health services and oncology services will be shifted to the direct national health insurance grant, now that provinces have demonstrated their readiness to take over the functions. The shifted funds will follow the financial management and procurement process of the grant recipient, which is monitored by the national Department of Health to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Division of Revenue Act and avoid wastage.

    "recommendation": "2022 BUDGET REVIEW 104 This annexure provides responses to the portfolio committees’ recommendations and recommendations from finance committees where they relate to the National Treasury. A number of committees recommended making additional budget allocations available for certain programmes, sub‐programmes or other budget items. Due to the constrained fiscal outlook, there is limited scope to implement these recommendations. However, departments, public entities and other institutions can reprioritise existing funds for new priorities, and in many cases have been able to do so. Portfolio Committee on Employment and Labour The committee demands to receive written monthly progress reports on the engagements between the Department of Employment and Labour and the National Treasury on financial sustainability of the Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE) factories. The department has been advised to resolve the corporate form of the SEE by engaging with the Public Entities Governance Unit in the National Treasury. This may require a new business case, as the business case and implementation plan done in 2012 was not fulfilled. The department will provide monthly reports on these engagements. A preferential procurement framework for government entities is being explored as part of the new Public Procurement Bill, which will aid the SEE factories. Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology The committee noted that with the current funding for ministerial approved programmes at 62 per cent, the department will not be able to meet the enrolment target as per the National Development Plan (NDP). The committee recommends that consideration be made towards progressively injecting additional funds to achieve the 80 per cent funding. The National Treasury acknowledges this recommendation. In light of the limited resources available to government, the Department of Higher Education and Training has had to tailor enrolment funding for the technical and vocational education and training colleges to align it to the funding available. Should the government’s fiscal position improve, the department will be considered for additional resources. The committee recommends additional funding towards the Community Education and Training (CET), especially given the high rate of youth unemployment and the growing number of youths not in education, employment or training. The National Treasury shares the committee’s concern about the high rate of youth unemployment and the need to provide opportunities for young people. At present, enrolment at CET colleges is relatively low because of low demand rather than limited funding. Improving efficiency, including providing more relevant courses, is likely to encourage more young people to enrol at CET colleges. The committee implores the National Treasury to consider additional funding for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) to avert the instability and unfortunate loss of lives experienced at the beginning of the 2021 academic year. Cabinet is engaging with input from the Ministerial Task Team on Student Funding to find a sustainable solution to the increasing demand to provide fee‐free higher education funding. Funding of the current model has been supplemented by an additional allocation of R32.6 billion over the medium term. The committee requests that consideration for additional funding should be made to increase administrative expenditure of the NSFAS as the current administrative budget imposes limitations on the improvements that the Scheme can implement to improve efficiencies, including ICT challenges. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 105 The Department of Higher Education and Training has reprioritised R65 million from savings on unfilled posts in 2021/22. The funds will be used by NSFAS to address its information and communications technology challenges. Further savings may be found by addressing inefficiencies in NSFAS’s current operations. The committee recommends that the National Treasury considers the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) request for additional funding so that the entity can fulfil its mandate and deliver services within the set turnaround times. The Department of Higher Education and Training has reprioritised funding from its baseline to allocate an additional R10.6 million to SAQA over the medium‐term expenditure framework (MTEF) period. Portfolio Committee on Sport, Arts and Culture The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance should prioritise adequate funding and allocation towards the implementation of the White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage over the MTEF period. As noted, there is little scope to provide additional funding at this time. The Department of Sport, Arts and Culture is advised to reprioritise funds in order to implement the White Paper. The department's budget was reduced by R956 million due to COVID‐19 reprioritisation. The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance consider increasing the department's budget for 2022/23 to ensure that the department can fully deliver on its mandate. The department reallocated funds unspent due to COVID‐19 restrictions within its baseline. The 2022/23 baseline is not affected and does not require any upward adjustment. Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities The committee requests the National Treasury to consider the condonation requests by the department and the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE). The National Treasury will consider the condonation requests in line with the irregular expenditure framework when these are submitted by the department and the CGE. The committee requests the National Treasury to consider the requests for roll‐over of funds for the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities and the CGE. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. Requests for rollovers are considered by an internal Treasury committee, guided by Treasury Regulation 6.4. Rollovers that meet the requirements and are approved by the Minister of Finance will be included in the Adjustments Appropriation Bill. The committee requests the National and Provincial Treasuries to provide a detailed report on the funding of the Sanitary Dignity programme (SDP). In 2021/22, R217.3 million was allocated to this programme. Of this amount, R121 million was allocated to provincial departments of education, which implement the programme in five provinces. The remaining R96.3 million was allocated to provincial departments of social development, which implement the programme in the other four provinces. As noted in the 2021 Budget, the relevant provincial departments are best placed to provide more information on funding for these programmes.",

Over the 2022 MTEF period, government has set aside R360 million to support the pilot phase of the Tourism Equity Fund introduced in 2021. Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans The committee notes with concern the Department of Defence’s (DoD) continuous overspending on compensation of employees against the ceiling set by the National Treasury that again resulted in irregular expenditure in 2020/21. This concern requires short‐term and long‐term solutions. The National Treasury should reconsider assisting the DoD with its plans to cut compensation of employees by providing additional funding for an exit mechanism. Furthermore, the National Treasury should indicate to the committee whether it is willing to start funding such a mechanism should the DoD show success in the implementation of its plans to curtail compensation of employees’ expenditure. The National Treasury agrees that the department requires both a short‐ and long‐term plan to manage compensation spending pressures. The department is allocated R1.8 billion over the medium term to implement an exit mechanism that includes employee‐initiated severance packages and early retirement without penalising pension benefits. The committee is aware of the fiscal constraints and noted National Treasury’s previous response to the BRRR [budgetary review and recommendation report] that no funds were available for a ring‐fenced allocation to fund the midlife upgrades of the South African Navy (SA Navy) vessels. However, the committee again recommends that National Treasury reprioritise funds to provide a ring‐fenced allocation to upgrade the SA Navy’s Frigate and Submarine fleet in the coming years. The non‐availability of naval platforms due to maintenance requirements results in the SA Navy not achieving its targets for coastal patrols and sea hours, thus affecting its constitutional mandate to ensure the territorial integrity of South Africa. Additional funding over the medium term for the midlife upgrade is therefore essential. The National Treasury notes the committee’s concern. Given the limited scope to provide additional funding, the National Treasury’s recent engagements with the department have focused on resolving its immediate compensation spending pressures. The reforms described above are expected to generate savings that can be used for other priorities such as the midlife upgrade of the SA Navy vessels. Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services In addition to recommending that zero budget reductions are applied in the case of the National Prosecuting Authority, Legal Aid South Africa, the Special Investigating Unit, the South African Human Rights Commission and the Public Protector South Africa, the committee recommends that additional funding be provided to:  Legal Aid South Africa to establish a Land Rights Management Unit that can provide legal services to poor and vulnerable persons seeking land justice  the Information Regulator for additional capacity  the South African Human Rights Commission to appoint additional monitoring staff; upgrade and replace outdated ICT; and fulfil its coordinating role in respect of the National Preventative Mechanism ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 107 established in terms of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  Public Protector South Africa to fill vacancies, employ subject matter experts for complex investigations, and provide for security and skills development. The baseline budgets for justice‐related institutions are not reduced in the 2022 Budget. Additional funding has been allocated through reprioritisation, as discussed in Chapter 5. Funds will also be transferred to Legal Aid South Africa, in line with current budget processes, to enable the entity to provide the specified legal services upon receipt of a formal request to facilitate such a transfer from the institutions involved. No additional funding is allocated to the Information Regulator, although R105 million was provided in the 2021 Budget to enable it to grow and meet its legislative mandate. Portfolio Committee on Police The committee recommends that the South African Police Service (SAPS) meets with the National Treasury to reopen negotiations on developing the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) as a separate programme within the SAPS and provide a report. The National Treasury has discussed this matter with SAPS and the DPCI, including most recently at a meeting with the DPCI in December 2021. It is not feasible to separate the DPCI from SAPS, mainly because the operational functions of the DPCI are interlinked with the existing Detective Services Programme within SAPS. The South African Police Service Amendment Act (2012), which establishes the DPCI, distinguishes its functions and provides it operational independence from SAPS. For budgeting purposes, however, the DPCI falls within the purpose and definition of the Detective Services Programme. The budget for the DPCI is specifically and exclusively appropriated so that it can only use funds for their intended purpose and, importantly, its budget cannot be changed without Parliament’s approval. Furthermore, as a subprogramme, the performance of the DPCI can be tracked, monitored and reported on separately in SAPS reports. The committee recommends that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) report back on its plans to procure independent technical reports. The committee recommends that the National Treasury considers making funds available to enable this to happen. Although the current fiscal context and constrained budget does not allow for additional funds at this time, the National Treasury has engaged with the IPID on its budget constraints and cost containment measures. The National Treasury also identified inefficiencies and possible savings in information and communication technologies through a spending review. Portfolio Committee on Transport The Minister of Finance, through the National Treasury, should assist the Department of Transport and its entities, along with the Auditor General of South Africa, to obtain a definitive dented interpretation of decision of supply chain management terminology and issues raised with B‐BBEE compliance requirements in order to prevent future disputes during the audit process. Accounting officers and executive authorities are responsible for managing their supply chains. In addition, the National Treasury provides support through toolkits. Departments and entities can leverage the courses and training programmes offered to familiarise themselves with the relevant subject matter and generally accepted definitions and terminologies. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer will continue to publish invitations widely for training that it offers.",

    "recommendation": "2022 BUDGET REVIEW 108 The Minister of Finance through the National Treasury must assist the Department of Transport in finalising a new feasibility study linked to the future of Moloto Rail Corridor and other high‐speed rail corridors. The committee made a similar recommendation in the 2021 Budget. The option of building a new railway line along the Moloto Corridor was explored in a feasibility study undertaken by the Department of Transport in 2015. The National Treasury’s evaluation of the feasibility study concluded that a railway link through the Moloto Corridor route would be unaffordable and unsustainable for both commuters and the fiscus. However, the feasibility study did provide grounds for improvements to the road infrastructure and transport services along the route, which has led to accelerated work on the Moloto development corridor. A more detailed response has also been provided to the Select Committee on Appropriation in its recommendation on the 2019 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill. The Standing Committee on Finance The committee is concerned with the dire situation at the Land Bank, especially since it failed to table its annual report for the 2020/21 financial year as its audit is still outstanding. The committee notes that the situation at the Land Bank has deteriorated after it defaulted on its debt about two years ago. We note further that the Land Bank has not yet finalised the liability solution to address the liquidity challenges and that this poses significant uncertainty regarding its going concern status. The committee urges the Minister of Finance to heighten his oversight and monitoring over the Land Bank in order to ensure that related financial and economic risks associated with it are mitigated. The committee will do an oversight visit to the Land Bank in the next quarter in order to get a detailed presentation on the challenges it faces, together with its insurance companies. The Land Bank has made progress in addressing its financial challenges, which is reflected in an improvement in its 2020/21 audit relative to its 2019/20 audit outcomes. Chapter 8 provides more detail on these developments. The committee notes that the South African Revenue Service (SARS) still has a large funding deficit of about R9 billion over three years. The committee notes some assurance from the Deputy Minister of Finance that budgetary processes were being undertaken in order to close this deficit. The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance considers favourably SARS’s additional financial requirements as this could assist in rebuilding its capacity to serve taxpayers and collect more revenue. Government is experiencing fiscal constraints and reprioritisation is the main policy tool for making funding available. Over the 2021 MTEF period, R3 billion was allocated to SARS to support capacity‐ building initiatives. The National Treasury will continue to engage SARS on its funding challenges in light of the importance of its work. Recommendations of the Standing and Select Committee on Finance on the",

    "recommendation": "2022 Budget allocates additional amounts of R6.2 billion in 2023/24 and R8.5 billion in 2024/25 to ensure that social grants rise in line with inflation over the MTEF period. In addition, R44 billion is allocated to extend the special COVID‐19 social relief of distress grant for 12 months until March 2023. ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 109 In the 2021 Fiscal Framework Report of the Committee, we stated that “in view of the COVID‐19 related job losses, increasing poverty and inequality, the NT and the government should seriously consider a basic income grant after the necessary consultations with the relevant stakeholders”. The Committee expects to hear concrete announcements on this when the Minister delivers the 2022 Budget in February. The COVID‐19 pandemic increased national debate on the possibility of a universal basic income grant and government is considering various proposals in this regard. It is essential to maintain social protection in a sustainable way. As discussed in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3, any proposals to expand this system need to be fully and appropriately financed by closing existing programmes to free up revenue, or through permanent increases in revenue collection. The committee notes comments from some stakeholders that the risk statement in the 2021 MTBPS may be narrow, leaving out a number of other real risks such as the recurrence of social unrest and inadequate contingency reserves. The committee recommends that the National Treasury takes note of these concerns and seek to broaden its risk identification and analysis so that adequate mitigation measures can be catered for in the fiscal framework. The National Treasury welcomes the proposal and will continue to assess risks as they arise. The fiscal risk statement (Annexure A in the MTBPS) focuses on medium‐ and longer‐term risks to the public finances. Short‐term risks are discussed in Chapter 3 of the MTBPS. Government faces a range of fiscal risks over the medium to longer term. Major risks identified in the 2021 MTBPS include, but are not limited to, the durability of the economic recovery, litigation relating to public‐service compensation, future wage negotiations and the financial state of several state‐owned companies and municipalities. The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance reports quarterly on the effectiveness of the National Treasury’s debt management strategies that would ensure that the level of debt stabilises over the medium term and avoids a sovereign debt crisis. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and will provide quarterly reports. It publishes a public debt management report every year. The committee recommends that the Public Procurement Bill be brought to Parliament and the processing of Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act be acted on with urgency. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The draft Public Procurement Bill was gazetted for public comment in February 2020. The revised bill needs to be approved by the Minister of Finance, submitted to the National Economic Development and Labour Council for consultation, and then approved by Cabinet before its introduction in Parliament. The National Treasury is processing public comments on the second draft of Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act (1956) and will submit a final version to the Minister of Finance for gazetting shortly. The committee notes that the Financial Action Task Force’s Mutual Evaluation Report found gaps in the implementation of South Africa’s anti‐money laundering and terrorist financing measures. The committee requests a briefing on this report by the National Treasury and the Financial Intelligence Centre. The National Treasury will present a report to Parliament on the Financial Action Task Force’s Mutual Evaluation Report and introduce urgent legislation aimed at addressing shortcomings identified in the mutual evaluation.",

This will assist the committee to avoid recommending the appropriation of funds that will not be spent and possible future reductions of this grant. The recommendation has been referred to the Department of Transport. The National Treasury notes that the public transport network grant for the City of Cape Town was reduced to align it with the City’s revised implementation plan for MyCiTi phase 2A. Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill That the Minister of Basic Education ensures that the Department of Basic Education provides a detailed report on the planning and framework used by various schools while using the R6 billion allocation for the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative to fund the employment of education assistants and general school assistants at public ordinary schools and public special schools. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Basic Education. That the Minister of Basic Education ensures that the Department of Basic Education (DBE) provides Parliament with a detailed plan and timeframes on how the department plans to ensure that all schools have access to decent water and sanitation by the end of 2022 as part of the Sanitation Appropriate for Education initiative. Furthermore, the DBE must provide a detailed list of all the schools that have inappropriate water and sanitation per province and regions, as well as the plan as to when each of these schools’ water and sanitation needs will be addressed. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Basic Education. That the Minister of Social Development ensures that the Department of Social Development (DSD) provides a comprehensive report to Parliament on the policy around the funding and subsequent deployment of social work graduates who are beneficiaries of the government bursary scheme. Furthermore, the DSD must provide a comprehensive expenditure report on the numbers of social workers that were funded through the government bursary scheme over the last five financial years, the total amount spent, and the number of those graduates who were placed to work areas by the department. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Social Development. On the proposed allocation reduction of R1.3 billion on the public transport network grant for the City of Cape Town, the Minister of Transport and the City of Cape Town provides a detailed report to Parliament on the reasons and implications for the delays in implementing the MyCiTi phase 2A.

Furthermore, the Minister is requested to ensure that the DoH provide the committee with a progress report on both the Limpopo Academic and Klipfontein hospitals. The DoH must provide a report on the possible service delivery implications of the proposed reduction of funds to these projects. This recommendation has been referred to the Department of Health.

The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting. Moreover, funding was provided for projects that were ready for implementation, based on the strength of the application submitted. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Adjustments Appropriation Bill The National Treasury should ensure that any movement of funds is always done according to the provisions of the Public Finance Management Act (1999) and Treasury Regulations. The committee does not support any movement of funds emanating from poor planning and performance by government departments. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation. Virements and shifting of funds are always carried out in line with the relevant legislation and regulations, including those cited by the committee. The National Treasury should approve the rollover amount of R2.8 billion in line with the Public Finance Management Act and Treasury Regulations for projects that have already been committed or nearing completion. However, the rolling over of funds due to poor project management, planning and execution cannot be allowed. The National Treasury notes the recommendation by the committee. Requests for rollovers are always considered within the parameters set by Treasury Regulation 6.4. The National Treasury and the Department of Social Development should consider extending the R350 temporary special COVID‐19 social relief of distress grant beyond March 2022, considering budgetary constraints and depending on the COVID‐19 impact and economic recovery plans.",

    "recommendation": "25 per cent package cut for members of the Cabinet, provincial executive and mayoral committees, as well as executive managers in the state, entities, state‐owned entities and metropolitan municipalities. The National Treasury agrees that remuneration packages in state‐owned companies need to be better aligned with the public‐service remuneration framework. Nevertheless, this would require legislative changes for certain state‐owned companies, as remuneration in state‐owned companies is governed by their boards. Remuneration matters relating to public office bearers are governed by the Independent Commission for The Remuneration of Public Office‐Bearers. The National Treasury’s role is to advise on proposed recommendations, in light of the macroeconomic and fiscal position of the country. The committee notes COSATU’s recommendation that government should consider reversing budget cuts to key programmes that will impact on its ability to implement industrial, manufacturing and export programmes to improve economic growth. As noted, the fiscal outlook is highly constrained at this time. If fiscal constraints ease, priority programmes may be considered for additional funding. The committee has long supported gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming; and further stresses the importance of recognising the rights, needs and interests of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, and asexual or ally (LGBTQIA+) community and requests the National Treasury to, in future, explicitly set out what cross‐cutting funding furthers these. The National Treasury and Cabinet should look into these matters very closely and the committee will monitor this. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and will update the committee as its work develops. It is working with other stakeholders to implement gender‐responsive budgeting across government. This is expected to roll out in the 2023 MTEF process. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill The National Treasury and Cabinet should take into consideration the existing capacity of the officials and institutions to properly spend additional funds when allocations are made to various provinces and municipalities. The situation where poor planning and lack of capacity to implement projects result in poor spending, unnecessary rollovers and deviations, cannot be allowed to continue. The relevant Minister must further ensure that the implementation of consequence management is fast‐tracked and, where necessary, law enforcement agencies are brought on board to recover any financial losses to the state and hold the implicated officials or politicians accountable. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Sector departments facilitate the process of determining the allocations for provinces and municipalities for conditional grants. This process includes developing mechanisms to assess the plans that provinces and municipalities submit and to provide guidance on the implementation of these plans. The conditional grant frameworks also include details on compliance requirements for conditional grant allocations. For funds to be rolled over, sector departments, provinces and municipalities need to comply with predetermined criteria, including an assessment of spending capacity. While the committee welcomes the increased allocation for local government over the medium‐term period, the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 together with their provincial counterparts and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA), need to work together to ensure that suitably qualified and experienced individuals are appointed to improve financial management capacity and service delivery in local government. Municipalities are responsible for appointing their employees. The National Treasury has shared minimum requirements for appointments in certain positions in municipalities. The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (DCoG), together with their provincial counterparts, should ensure that concerns raised by SALGA around the correctness of assumptions about collection of own revenue, contained in the 1998 Local Government White Paper, are addressed urgently. This issue was discussed extensively in the 2020 and 2021 Budget Forum lekgotla. SALGA, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, the National Treasury and the Financial and Fiscal Commission are implementing the resolutions and tracking quarterly progress. A Budget Forum session is expected to provide feedback around March 2022. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) needs to work with SALGA to fast‐track the implementation of the resolution around unfunded mandates, which was taken during the Local Government Budget Lekgotla in December 2020 and further ensure that funds always follow function. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to CoGTA and SALGA. A Budget Forum session is expected to provide feedback around March 2022. The provincial departments of cooperative governance and provincial treasuries should work with SALGA to ensure that proper interventions and systems to monitor service delivery in local government are implemented to address the issues around water losses and electricity challenges. Moreover, the committee is of the view that the provincial executives of both finance and cooperative governance need to again work with SALGA to enforce consequence management in relation to negative performance reports, failure to submit financial statements, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure using the monthly and quarterly reports they receive. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the provincial departments of cooperative governance and treasuries. The National Treasury should be proactive in ascertaining which provinces will not spend their housing budgets to ensure appropriate remedial actions are taken immediately, including the transfer of the funds to better performing provinces, and avoid last‐minute gazettes, fruitless and wasteful expenditure and fiscal dumping towards the end of the financial year. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Departments are responsible for administering and monitoring performance within the conditional grants. The National Treasury supports departments through the implementation of the Division of Revenue Act. In terms of this act, any reallocation of funds in terms of section 19(1) requires transferring departments to consider whether the reallocated amounts will be spent within the same financial year. The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should ensure that challenges around delays and poor contracting, which led to the roll‐over amount of R582 million for the Vaal River Pollution Remediation Project in Emfuleni local municipality, are addressed and the work verification process is completed for invoices to be paid as required. Otherwise, such delays will have a negative impact on the project completion timelines, service providers’ cash flows and the livelihoods of their employees.",

    "recommendation": "2022 BUDGET REVIEW 114 The National Treasury will engage the Department of Water and Sanitation on how this project can be fast‐tracked. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, together with its provincial counterparts, should fast‐track the implementation of the district development model to ensure systems are in place for more integrated delivery of services and ensure sufficient capacity, by driving coordination and alignment of processes, which have been a challenge in the local government sphere for many years. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The Department of Basic Education, together with provincial education departments, should ensure that the lack of parity between provinces regarding the stipend paid to early childhood development workers is urgently addressed, once the function shift from the Department of Social Development has been completed. COSATU and other federations should work with government to address this. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Basic Education. The National Treasury and the Department of Transport, together with their provincial counterparts, should make sure that allocations earmarked for the provincial roads maintenance grant are utilised effectively, according to the grant framework, to address the poor state of some provincial roads, which negatively affects economic activities. The quality of material used, workmanship and procurement processes for such projects need to improve in order to realise value for money. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Transport. The two departments are developing criteria for allocating grant funding earmarked for performance incentives. With regard to hospital infrastructure maintenance, the National Treasury and the Department of Health, together with their provincial counterparts, should ensure that more resources are earmarked to deal with the current poor state of some hospital infrastructure, which requires proper maintenance in various provinces, especially given the advent of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Furthermore, the quality of workmanship and material and procurement processes for such projects need to improve to achieve value for money. Government provides substantial funding for this purpose, including through the health facility revitalisation grant. This conditional grant, which was allocated R21.3 billion over the 2022 MTEF period, is transferred to provinces for the construction and maintenance of health infrastructure. In addition, provincial departments of health fund infrastructure maintenance through their own budgets. At present, there is limited scope for additional fiscal resources. The recommendation has also been referred to the Department of Health. The Department of Water and Sanitation, together with the Western Cape Provincial Treasury, should ensure that the implementation of the potable water security and remedial works project is expedited in the George Local Municipality and the allocated funds are spent according to the framework of the regional bulk infrastructure grant to ensure improved access to clean, drinkable water for all. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Department of Water and Sanitation, the Western Cape Provincial Treasury and the National Treasury will monitor performance in this municipality through the monthly and quarterly performance reports required by the Division of Revenue Act. The National Treasury and the Department of Basic Education should ensure that the rollover amount of R210 million for the school infrastructure backlogs grant to complete projects that are part of the Sanitation Appropriate for Education initiative is properly spent to expedite the replacement and removal ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 115 of inappropriate and unsuitable sanitation in certain provinces. The committee is of the view that the pace at which this initiative is implemented, is unacceptably slow given that this programme started in 2010. The department should expand the programme to include the eradication of asbestos schools in certain provinces, if not already included. The National Treasury has referred the recommendation to the Department of Basic Education and will continue to monitor the monthly spending in line with its oversight role. The National Treasury and Department of Public Service and Administration, together with provincial treasuries, should ensure the effective implementation of the wage agreement of the Public Service Co‐ ordinating Bargaining Council for the 2021/22 financial year for public‐sector workers, according to the agreed terms. This should bring the much‐needed certainty and stability in the public service to ensure uninterrupted service delivery to the poor and vulnerable. Furthermore, government needs to ensure that funded vacant posts are filled urgently. COSATU and other federations should work with government to ensure progress in this regard. Additional funds have been allocated to provincial transfers for provinces to pay the cash gratuity for public‐service employees resulting from the 2021 wage agreement. The National Treasury has also referred the recommendation to the Department of Public Service and Administration. The headcount cuts for the South African Police Service and teachers need to be reversed in order to protect frontline service delivery. The committee is of the view that the headcount cuts should happen at the management level of each department as opposed to the levels at which services are being delivered. Government’s fiscal consolidation strategy requires departments to contain expenditure on employee compensation. The National Treasury has encouraged departments to protect frontline services to the degree possible, but management of personnel numbers and compensation spending are departmental prerogatives. The 2022 Budget provides additional funding for the police, education and health sectors over the next three years to address some of these challenges. The National Treasury and Cabinet need to ensure that concrete steps are taken to monitor the impact of the well‐funded employment creation programmes, such as the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative, to achieve value for money and avoid mistakes that might have occurred in similar programmes in the past. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting so that it can monitor impact, along with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Second Special Appropriation Bill The Minister of Finance should ensure that the South African Special Risk Insurance Association (SASRIA) SOC Ltd expedites the process of verifying and validating additional claims, as well as sharing its revenue model with government and employing clear measures to cover for all additional claims and to address any possible negative impact on its solvency ratio.

The relevant allocations were specifically to provide for unforeseen costs resulting from public violence in July 2021 and for the deployment of the SANDF in Mozambique. The National Treasury and the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, together with the Department of Small Business Development, should reconsider and address rigid bureaucratic processes for small, medium and micro enterprises to access government support relief funds and develop adequate communication mechanisms to ensure that all businesses in townships and rural areas, which were affected by the unrest, are part of the government relief support. The National Treasury evaluates programmes, recommends funding and, if funding is approved, monitors expenditure and performance. Departments are responsible for designing and administering their programmes, including ensuring they meet their objectives. The recommendation has also been referred to the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition and the Department of Small Business Development. The Minister of Finance, together with the Ministers of Social Development; Trade, Industry and Competition; Police; and Defence, should ensure that all additional funds earmarked for their respective departments are spent according to the approved departmental plans and within the ambit of the Second Special Appropriation Act (2021); and further ensure that clear internal controls and financial management systems are put in place to prevent poor performance and wasteful and fruitless expenditure, and that consequence management is enforced and implemented, where necessary, to deal with issues of financial misconduct and corruption. The National Treasury agrees with the committee’s recommendation and will continue to monitor the use of the allocated funds as part of its spending oversight of departments.

Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the proposed division of revenue and conditional grant allocations to provinces and municipalities as contained in the 2021 MTBPS While noting the impact of COVID‐19 on the economy, the committee is of the view that the National Treasury and Cabinet should outline and continue to intensify efforts to develop policies, interventions and measures to grow the economy in the 2022 Budget, to avoid a situation where transfers to provinces and municipalities continue to grow below inflation. This will also assist in better managing the escalating cost of government debt, which negatively affects resources to deliver basic services to the poor and vulnerable. The National Treasury agrees that policies should aim to raise economic growth to increase fiscal resources and help manage escalating debt. The 2022 Budget is aimed at achieving these objectives. As noted, the fiscal position is highly constrained, affecting the rate at which transfers to provinces and municipalities grow. While welcoming the annual update of the provincial equitable share (PES) formula to ensure fair funding allocations to each province, the committee urges the National Treasury and the Department of Health to expedite the process of phasing in the changes to the health component between the 2022/23 and 2024/25 financial years, which accounts for 27 per cent of the formula. In addition, the National Treasury, ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 117 together with provincial treasuries, should ensure that monitoring systems and controls are put in place to achieve effective and efficient spending of the PES.

    "recommendation": "2022 MTEF period to help provinces adapt to the resulting changes in their equitable share allocations. The National Treasury, alongside provincial treasuries, will continue to monitor spending of the provincial equitable share in line with its oversight role. While the introduction of various components into the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant over the years is welcomed, the National Treasury and Department of Health should ensure that this conditional grant expenditure is improved and implemented according to the division of revenue framework. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. From the 2022 MTEF period, the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant will be restructured to address concerns over its spending and management arising from the introduction of various new components. The restructured grant, the district health programmes grant, will have two components: the comprehensive HIV/AIDS component and the district health component. The components that were created for mental health services and oncology services will be shifted to the direct national health insurance grant. Spending and management of conditional grants are monitored by relevant national departments and the National Treasury in line with the Division of Revenue Act. While the committee welcomes the shifting of the mental health and oncology components introduced in the HIV, TB, malaria and community outreach grant in the 2021 MTEF to the direct national health insurance grant for provinces; the National Treasury and the Department of Health need to make sure that sound financial management and procurement processes are strengthened for provincial health departments to avoid wastage. The National Treasury should report on this matter during the next budget process. This recommendation is noted. The components that were created for mental health services and oncology services will be shifted to the direct national health insurance grant, now that provinces have demonstrated their readiness to take over the functions. The shifted funds will follow the financial management and procurement process of the grant recipient, which is monitored by the national Department of Health to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Division of Revenue Act and avoid wastage. The Department of Basic Education, together with provincial education departments, should ensure that the lack of parity between provinces regarding the stipend paid to early childhood development workers is urgently addressed once the function shift from the Department of Social Development has been completed.

The Department of Transport monitors provincial compliance in the provincial road maintenance grant. Measures to address non‐compliance include withholding transfers. While the committee welcomes the expansion of scope for the municipal infrastructure grant (MIG) to help municipalities to improve their asset management practices; the committee urges the Department of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs to fast‐track the process of identifying municipalities that require such intervention for funds to be earmarked in the 2022/23 financial year. The National Treasury must report on this during the next budget process. The National Treasury acknowledges the urgency of finalising this process. The Department of Cooperative Governance expects to identify these municipalities by end‐February 2022, at which point it will notify them and discuss entering into a memorandum of understanding. The implementation plan for municipalities is expected to be finalised by April 2022. While the committee welcomes the increased allocation for local government over the medium‐term period, the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, together with their provincial counterparts and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA), need to work together to ensure that suitably qualified and experienced individuals are appointed in finance units at municipalities. The committee is of the view that building the required in‐house capacity is paramount for any stable government and therefore the amount of R1 billion reportedly spent on consultants to compile municipal financial reports is highly unacceptable, especially when municipal finance management units have been established in the provincial treasuries to also assist. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. It will work with provincial treasuries to strengthen the capacity of municipal officials in financial management units through the local government financial management grant. The National Treasury, together with Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, should ensure that institutional problems at local government are adequately diagnosed before solutions are developed and the current fragmented capacity‐building programmes are reviewed and tailored to respond to specific capacity challenges affecting local government finances. They should also ensure that municipal finance management units are strengthened and accountability is enforced, both politically and administratively, to ensure consequence management for transgressors. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation, which aligns with the findings from its recent review of the capacity‐building system for local government. Chapter 6 provides more detail on the review and steps that will follow. The Committee notes with concern the growing trend of allocating indirect grants which creates a false narrative of increased allocations to local government when in fact these are merely national department projects being rolled out at local level; and therefore wishes to emphasise the importance of the three spheres of government and the important distinctions between the spheres. The lack of capacity at certain municipalities to spend should not disadvantage those municipalities that are able to spend their direct conditional grants. In addition, the administering department should ensure that municipalities who are unable to spend, are capacitated to perform better. The National Treasury notes these concerns. The National Treasury is in discussions with departments on possible reforms to creating new indirect grants and changes to some of the management rules given the insufficient enforcement measures within the Division of Revenue Act.",

    "recommendation": "25 per cent package cut for members of the Cabinet, provincial executive and mayoral committees, as well as executive managers in the state, entities, state‐owned entities and metropolitan municipalities. The National Treasury agrees that remuneration packages in state‐owned companies need to be better aligned with the public‐service remuneration framework. Nevertheless, this would require legislative changes for certain state‐owned companies, as remuneration in state‐owned companies is governed by their boards. Remuneration matters relating to public office bearers are governed by the Independent Commission for The Remuneration of Public Office‐Bearers. The National Treasury’s role is to advise on proposed recommendations, in light of the macroeconomic and fiscal position of the country. The committee notes COSATU’s recommendation that government should consider reversing budget cuts to key programmes that will impact on its ability to implement industrial, manufacturing and export programmes to improve economic growth. As noted, the fiscal outlook is highly constrained at this time. If fiscal constraints ease, priority programmes may be considered for additional funding. The committee has long supported gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming; and further stresses the importance of recognising the rights, needs and interests of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, and asexual or ally (LGBTQIA+) community and requests the National Treasury to, in future, explicitly set out what cross‐cutting funding furthers these. The National Treasury and Cabinet should look into these matters very closely and the committee will monitor this. The National Treasury welcomes this recommendation and will update the committee as its work develops. It is working with other stakeholders to implement gender‐responsive budgeting across government. This is expected to roll out in the 2023 MTEF process. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Appropriations on the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill The National Treasury and Cabinet should take into consideration the existing capacity of the officials and institutions to properly spend additional funds when allocations are made to various provinces and municipalities. The situation where poor planning and lack of capacity to implement projects result in poor spending, unnecessary rollovers and deviations, cannot be allowed to continue. The relevant Minister must further ensure that the implementation of consequence management is fast‐tracked and, where necessary, law enforcement agencies are brought on board to recover any financial losses to the state and hold the implicated officials or politicians accountable. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Sector departments facilitate the process of determining the allocations for provinces and municipalities for conditional grants. This process includes developing mechanisms to assess the plans that provinces and municipalities submit and to provide guidance on the implementation of these plans. The conditional grant frameworks also include details on compliance requirements for conditional grant allocations. For funds to be rolled over, sector departments, provinces and municipalities need to comply with predetermined criteria, including an assessment of spending capacity. While the committee welcomes the increased allocation for local government over the medium‐term period, the National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 113 together with their provincial counterparts and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA), need to work together to ensure that suitably qualified and experienced individuals are appointed to improve financial management capacity and service delivery in local government. Municipalities are responsible for appointing their employees. The National Treasury has shared minimum requirements for appointments in certain positions in municipalities. The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (DCoG), together with their provincial counterparts, should ensure that concerns raised by SALGA around the correctness of assumptions about collection of own revenue, contained in the 1998 Local Government White Paper, are addressed urgently. This issue was discussed extensively in the 2020 and 2021 Budget Forum lekgotla. SALGA, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, the National Treasury and the Financial and Fiscal Commission are implementing the resolutions and tracking quarterly progress. A Budget Forum session is expected to provide feedback around March 2022. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) needs to work with SALGA to fast‐track the implementation of the resolution around unfunded mandates, which was taken during the Local Government Budget Lekgotla in December 2020 and further ensure that funds always follow function. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to CoGTA and SALGA. A Budget Forum session is expected to provide feedback around March 2022. The provincial departments of cooperative governance and provincial treasuries should work with SALGA to ensure that proper interventions and systems to monitor service delivery in local government are implemented to address the issues around water losses and electricity challenges. Moreover, the committee is of the view that the provincial executives of both finance and cooperative governance need to again work with SALGA to enforce consequence management in relation to negative performance reports, failure to submit financial statements, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure using the monthly and quarterly reports they receive. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the provincial departments of cooperative governance and treasuries. The National Treasury should be proactive in ascertaining which provinces will not spend their housing budgets to ensure appropriate remedial actions are taken immediately, including the transfer of the funds to better performing provinces, and avoid last‐minute gazettes, fruitless and wasteful expenditure and fiscal dumping towards the end of the financial year. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Departments are responsible for administering and monitoring performance within the conditional grants. The National Treasury supports departments through the implementation of the Division of Revenue Act. In terms of this act, any reallocation of funds in terms of section 19(1) requires transferring departments to consider whether the reallocated amounts will be spent within the same financial year. The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs should ensure that challenges around delays and poor contracting, which led to the roll‐over amount of R582 million for the Vaal River Pollution Remediation Project in Emfuleni local municipality, are addressed and the work verification process is completed for invoices to be paid as required. Otherwise, such delays will have a negative impact on the project completion timelines, service providers’ cash flows and the livelihoods of their employees.",

    "recommendation": "2022 BUDGET REVIEW 114 The National Treasury will engage the Department of Water and Sanitation on how this project can be fast‐tracked. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, together with its provincial counterparts, should fast‐track the implementation of the district development model to ensure systems are in place for more integrated delivery of services and ensure sufficient capacity, by driving coordination and alignment of processes, which have been a challenge in the local government sphere for many years. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The Department of Basic Education, together with provincial education departments, should ensure that the lack of parity between provinces regarding the stipend paid to early childhood development workers is urgently addressed, once the function shift from the Department of Social Development has been completed. COSATU and other federations should work with government to address this. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Basic Education. The National Treasury and the Department of Transport, together with their provincial counterparts, should make sure that allocations earmarked for the provincial roads maintenance grant are utilised effectively, according to the grant framework, to address the poor state of some provincial roads, which negatively affects economic activities. The quality of material used, workmanship and procurement processes for such projects need to improve in order to realise value for money. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Transport. The two departments are developing criteria for allocating grant funding earmarked for performance incentives. With regard to hospital infrastructure maintenance, the National Treasury and the Department of Health, together with their provincial counterparts, should ensure that more resources are earmarked to deal with the current poor state of some hospital infrastructure, which requires proper maintenance in various provinces, especially given the advent of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Furthermore, the quality of workmanship and material and procurement processes for such projects need to improve to achieve value for money. Government provides substantial funding for this purpose, including through the health facility revitalisation grant. This conditional grant, which was allocated R21.3 billion over the 2022 MTEF period, is transferred to provinces for the construction and maintenance of health infrastructure. In addition, provincial departments of health fund infrastructure maintenance through their own budgets. At present, there is limited scope for additional fiscal resources. The recommendation has also been referred to the Department of Health. The Department of Water and Sanitation, together with the Western Cape Provincial Treasury, should ensure that the implementation of the potable water security and remedial works project is expedited in the George Local Municipality and the allocated funds are spent according to the framework of the regional bulk infrastructure grant to ensure improved access to clean, drinkable water for all. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Department of Water and Sanitation, the Western Cape Provincial Treasury and the National Treasury will monitor performance in this municipality through the monthly and quarterly performance reports required by the Division of Revenue Act. The National Treasury and the Department of Basic Education should ensure that the rollover amount of R210 million for the school infrastructure backlogs grant to complete projects that are part of the Sanitation Appropriate for Education initiative is properly spent to expedite the replacement and removal ANNEXURE A: REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT 115 of inappropriate and unsuitable sanitation in certain provinces. The committee is of the view that the pace at which this initiative is implemented, is unacceptably slow given that this programme started in 2010. The department should expand the programme to include the eradication of asbestos schools in certain provinces, if not already included. The National Treasury has referred the recommendation to the Department of Basic Education and will continue to monitor the monthly spending in line with its oversight role. The National Treasury and Department of Public Service and Administration, together with provincial treasuries, should ensure the effective implementation of the wage agreement of the Public Service Co‐ ordinating Bargaining Council for the 2021/22 financial year for public‐sector workers, according to the agreed terms. This should bring the much‐needed certainty and stability in the public service to ensure uninterrupted service delivery to the poor and vulnerable. Furthermore, government needs to ensure that funded vacant posts are filled urgently. COSATU and other federations should work with government to ensure progress in this regard. Additional funds have been allocated to provincial transfers for provinces to pay the cash gratuity for public‐service employees resulting from the 2021 wage agreement. The National Treasury has also referred the recommendation to the Department of Public Service and Administration. The headcount cuts for the South African Police Service and teachers need to be reversed in order to protect frontline service delivery. The committee is of the view that the headcount cuts should happen at the management level of each department as opposed to the levels at which services are being delivered. Government’s fiscal consolidation strategy requires departments to contain expenditure on employee compensation. The National Treasury has encouraged departments to protect frontline services to the degree possible, but management of personnel numbers and compensation spending are departmental prerogatives. The 2022 Budget provides additional funding for the police, education and health sectors over the next three years to address some of these challenges. The National Treasury and Cabinet need to ensure that concrete steps are taken to monitor the impact of the well‐funded employment creation programmes, such as the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative, to achieve value for money and avoid mistakes that might have occurred in similar programmes in the past. The National Treasury notes this recommendation. The Presidency has developed reporting requirements for this programme and requires monthly reporting so that it can monitor impact, along with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.

At the same time, departments need to consider more efficient alternatives and innovative solutions to delivering their mandate within the constrained budget.

Policy priorities in the science and innovation sector will need to be met through reallocations and reprioritisation. An interdepartmental task team has been established to improve planning and budget coordination of science, technology and innovation. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SPORT, ARTS AND CULTURE The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance should prioritise adequate funding and allocation towards the implementation of the White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage over the MTEF period. As noted, there is little scope to provide additional funding at this time. The Department of Sport, Arts and Culture is advised to reprioritise funds in order to implement the white paper in a phased manner. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON WOMEN, YOUTH AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES The committee requests the National Treasury to consider the condonation requests by the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities and the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE). Condonation requests are addressed in line with the irregular expenditure framework. The requirements of the framework will be applied when a request is submitted by the department and the CGE.

    "recommendation": "that Denel would be allocated R204.7 million to reduce its contingent liabilities arising from its weak financial position and R3.4 billion to complete its turnaround plan, provided it met the attached conditions. Although it has received the first amount of R204.7 million, it has not yet met the conditions for the R3.4 billion. Other key strategic and operational matters fall within the mandate of the Department of Public Enterprises. The committee further recommends that the Minister of Finance should consider creating an enabling environment to encourage public-public partnerships, where government departments and state-owned companies can collaborate to leverage on the capacity of the state. Secondly, government departments should be encouraged to use the services of state agencies and state owned companies. It is our view that Denel would be self-sustainable if its industrial and advanced manufacturing capabilities were used to produce vehicles and advanced technologies to enhance the work of the police and other departments. The recommendation is noted. The private-sector participation framework, endorsed by Cabinet in 2016, outlines financing strategies to enable infrastructure investments and considerations for state-owned enterprises to partner with private sector companies. Overall, Cabinet determines the strategic focus of state-owned enterprises and continuously deliberates on any reforms in this regard under the guidance of the Minister of Public Enterprises.

    "recommendation": "2023 Budget Review | 107 PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TOURISM The National Treasury should appropriate a ring-fenced budget that will be used to develop, enhance and market domestic tourism which is a cornerstone for successful tourism destinations. The National Treasury continues to engage departments on funding-related issues during the annual budget process. To support the tourism sector’s recovery, the Department of Tourism has reprioritised R540 million over the 2022 MTEF period to establish the Tourism Equity Fund. The committee recommends that the National Treasury appropriates budget that will allow sector recovery and assists in surpassing the 2019 performance levels before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The committee made a similar recommendation in the 2022 Budget. The National Treasury will continue to engage the Department of Tourism on funding‐related issues during the annual budget process and support efforts to enable the recovery of the tourism sector. As noted, the Department of Tourism has reprioritised R540 million over the 2022 MTEF period to establish the Tourism Equity Fund and support the tourism sector’s recovery. In addition, the department is allocated R180 million over the next three years to support the piloting of the Tourism Equity Fund introduced in 2021. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS The committee expresses its disappointment with the Department of Defence not correctly spending the allocation of R225 million over the MTEF on border safeguarding technology. The committee recommends that the department reprioritises R140 million from its allocation for 2023/24 for the purpose of border safeguarding technology as force multipliers. Subject to this reprioritisation being carried out and spent successfully, the committee then recommends further ring-fenced allocations for border safeguarding technology by National Treasury for the outer years of the 2023 MTEF. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Department of Defence is allocated additional funding of R500 million in 2024/25 and R200 million in 2025/26 to procure equipment and technology to aid the safeguarding of borders. These earmarked funds may not be used for any other purposes. Any changes to these amounts will require the National Treasury’s approval. As in the Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans’ BRRR [budgetary review and recommendation report] recommendations to the National Treasury in 2019, 2020 and 2021, the committee again recommends a ring-fenced allocation for the midlife upgrades of the SA Navy frigates and submarines. The committee is suggesting a staggered approach in this regard to limit the fiscal impact, but one that would ensure the midlife upgrades of all frigates and submarines over, for example, the next 7 to 10 years, starting in 2023/24. This will allow the SA Navy to appropriately plan vessel availability, adjust its sea-hour targets accordingly and report more accurately to Parliament. It would also add significant capacity in terms of maritime security which is currently characterised by very limited naval patrols. Consistent with the committee’s recommendation, the Department of Defence is allocated additional funding of R500 million in 2023/24, R441 million in 2024/25 and R480 million in 2025/26 for the midlife upgrades of the South African Navy’s frigates and submarines.

The National Treasury notes the committee’s concern. Since the 2022 Budget, no reductions have been made to the baselines of the department, its entities and related Chapter 9 institutions. Instead, the department has received additional allocations totalling R3.7 billion, the majority of which was allocated to the National Prosecuting Authority to strengthen capacity and advance the recommendations of the State Capture Commission. In addition, funds are provided to Legal Aid South Africa to appoint legal practitioners to service specialised commercial crimes courts, the Information Regulator to grow its establishment and effectively discharge its legislative mandate, the Public Protector and the South African Human Rights Commission to increase capacity and finance once-off information and communications technology, and the Special Investigating Unit to initiate civil litigation in the special tribunal flowing from proclamations that tie into the recommendations of the State Capture Commission for investigation.

    "recommendation": "that this should be taken into account during the budget adjustment period. Funds should be specifically made available for the appointment of IPID investigators to improve the ratio between police officers and IPID investigators. Due to the constrained fiscal outlook, there is limited scope to provide additional funding. The IPID has not demonstrated that it has the capacity to fully spend its allocated budget. Generally, the department underspends its budget for compensation of employees due to vacant funded posts. Accordingly, the IPID will need to demonstrate improved capacity to fill its vacant funded posts and reduce its underspending on compensation of employees before additional funding is considered. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT The Minister of Finance, through the National Treasury, should assist the Department of Transport and its entities, along with the Auditor General of South Africa, to obtain a definitive dented interpretation of decision of supply chain management terminology and issues raised with B-BBEE [broad-based black economic empowerment] compliance requirements in order to prevent future disputes during the audit process lined to these terms. The committee made a similar recommendation in the 2022 Budget. Accounting officers and executive authorities are responsible for managing their supply chains. In addition, the National Treasury provides support through toolkits. Departments and entities can leverage the courses and training programmes offered to familiarise themselves with the relevant subject matter and generally accepted definitions and terminologies. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer has dedicated officials that deal with queries from stakeholders and will continue to widely publish invitations for training that it offers. The process of getting B-BBEE certification lies outside the control of the National Treasury. The Minister of Finance should assist the Department of Transport in finalising a new feasibility study linked to the future of Moloto Rail Corridor and other high-speed rail corridors. The option of building a new railway line along the Moloto Corridor was explored in a feasibility study undertaken by the Department of Transport in 2015. The National Treasury’s evaluation of the feasibility study concluded that a railway link through the Moloto Corridor route would be unaffordable and unsustainable for both commuters and the fiscus. However, the feasibility study did provide grounds for improvements to the road infrastructure and transport services along the route, which has led to accelerated work on the Moloto development corridor. A more detailed response has also been provided to the Select Committee on Appropriation in its recommendation on the 2019 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill.

The National Treasury notes the committee’s recommendation. Over the medium term, the Department of Home Affairs will receive additional funding of R900 million for the Border Management Authority. In addition, R839.9 million is allocated in 2023/24 for the digitisation programme, of which R559.5 million is for compensation of employees and the remainder will be used to procure information and communications technology equipment and goods and services. The committee recommends that the current provision of services to clients on Saturdays and after 4pm should be revived and expanded by the Department of Home Affairs in negotiation with the National Treasury for funding and trade unions for staff interests prior to the end of the 2019/20 financial year. Consideration, in this regard should be given to the lost productive time for learners, businesses and employees as well as the essential nature of the services. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Home Affairs. Funding requests from departments for specific projects are dealt with through the annual budget process and presented in Parliament for consideration. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION The National School of Government (NSG) together with the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) should continue to engage the National Treasury in exploring alternative funding methods to ensure that the NSG is self-sustainable in the future years. The School’s proposal should be allowed by the National Treasury and the Cabinet which seek government departments including local government to set aside a particular percentage of their training budget to fund the NSG training courses. The DPSA, in collaboration with the NSG, is consulting the National Treasury on developing a directive on compulsory training programmes for the public service. The National Treasury has commented on the draft directive and advised the DPSA and the NSG on the feasible funding mechanisms for the proposed training programmes. Furthermore, the National Treasury has highlighted the importance of formulating the provisions of the directive in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act (1999) on the powers and responsibilities of accounting officers and the requirements of the supply chain or procurement management system. The National Treasury has also highlighted the legislative processes or arrangements that need to be followed for the NSG to be accorded a sole training provider status. Through the annual budget process, the National Treasury will continue to work with the DPSA and the NSG as they develop training policy mechanisms and funding mechanisms for the NSG.

    "recommendation": "2022 MTBPS estimated that gross loan debt would stabilise and a primary budget surplus would be achieved in 2022/23, showing that fiscal policy is achieving its objectives. Nevertheless, risks to the fiscal outlook are substantial, including due to a rise in debt and likely effects of the takeover of Eskom debt as announced in the 2022 MTBPS. Chapter 3 discusses fiscal policy in more detail. While NT is adamant that the 2022 MTBPS, and the Budget in general, is pro-poor, more and more people are unemployed and are trapped in poverty and inequality. The Committee remains extremely concerned about this, especially in the light of an economic growth rate that is too low to address poverty, inequality and unemployment challenges. The Committee recommends that the Budget should consider far more the impact of the high cost of living on the economy, particularly on the poor households. The National Treasury notes the committee’s recommendation. It is important to note that fiscal policy alone cannot solve the challenges of poverty and unemployment. The economic outlook is determined by a variety of factors that are mostly not in the control of fiscal policies. Nevertheless, the 2023 Budget continues to allocate the majority of spending to the social wage, which supports poorer households. In addition, the combined impact of structural reforms, support for small business and new infrastructure investment will enable higher rates of growth and job creation over the long term. The Committee notes the submissions made by the stakeholders regarding increasing the social grants and is sympathetic to them. The Committee also welcomes the extension of the SRD [social relief of distress] grant by another year. Given the consequences of Covid-19, the July 2021 social unrest, the KZN floods and the increased poverty, inequality and job losses, the unemployed and poor need to be cushioned more. The Committee reiterates its previous position that the National Treasury and government should seriously consider a Basic Income Grant (BIG). The National Treasury, together with partner departments, is reviewing options to provide appropriate social protection measures for the working-age population that can replace or complement the current COVID-19 social relief of distress grant. Any permanent increase in expenditure, such as a new social grant, will need to be matched by permanent revenue increases or spending reductions elsewhere. While the National Treasury expects gross loan debt to stabilise at 71.4 per cent of GDP in 2022/23, which is two years earlier and at a lower level than projected in the 2022 Budget Review, the Committee remains concerned about the high levels of the debt. The Committee reiterates its recommendation that the National Treasury reports quarterly to it on the effectiveness of its debt management strategies that would ensure that the level of debt stabilises over the medium term as ANNEXURE A REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT",

    "recommendation": "that the National Treasury confirmed that the risks previously identified in the 2022 Budget have already materialised. The continued bailout of SOEs [state-owned enterprises] undermines government’s fiscal stabilisation efforts. The Committee recommends that the bailing out of SOEs, which is one of the biggest risks to the fiscus, should be subject to stringent conditions and accountability measures. In this regard, the Committee notes the proposed conditional allocations to public entities such as Denel, SANRAL and Transnet in order to reduce contingent liabilities and enable these entities to continue supporting economic growth. The Committee recommends a similar approach as far as possible be taken on all SOE bail-outs. The National Treasury agrees with these recommendations. Chapter 8 discusses the new framework for state-owned companies, which will support the implementation of these recommendations. The Committee further recommends that the National Treasury should consider South African Institute of Chartered Accountants [SAICA] and Financial and Fiscal Commission [FFC] recommendations on SOEs, which include a focus on operational deficiencies and proper management of procurement, contracts and payments, a risk-based approach to government guarantees and that a differentiation be made between repair and maintenance spending versus funding for new infrastructure.

    "recommendation": "that could be implemented, within the constitutional and legislative mandate of SARB, which would not involve the aggressive hiking of the repo rate. Stable fiscal policy is a necessary condition for reducing pressure on monetary policy, particularly in a small open economy such as South Africa. At the same time, it is not a sufficient condition for eliminating it altogether. The National Treasury, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, sets the inflation target, which acts as a benchmark against which price stability is measured. The Reserve Bank then independently sets monetary policy to achieve this target. Fiscal policy and monetary policy both contribute to a stable macroeconomic framework to support investment, economic growth and job creation. The Reserve Bank considers many factors in its decision-making process. Fiscal policy remains focused on stabilising public debt and ensuring sustainable public finances in support of macroeconomic stability. At the same time, government enables economic and social development by maintaining a prudent fiscal stance, directing resources towards infrastructure, contributing to energy reforms and supporting the social wage. In the 2022 Budget Speech in February, the Minister of Finance stated that he had agreed with the Minister of Minerals and Energy to review all aspects of the fuel price. The Committee further notes and welcomes the fuel levy relief announced by the two Ministers in March and May 2022, with the aim of alleviating pressure of the rising fuel costs on households. The Committee requires that the Minister of Finance reports back to it on progress made in reviewing all aspects of the fuel price regime. The Minister of Finance has committed to reviewing the Road Accident Fund levy. The recommendation has been referred to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, which is responsible for reviewing the fuel price. The Committee notes that the 2022 MTBPS does not appear to have explicitly budgeted for fighting corruption and Gender Based Violence (GBV) while the levels of crime in the country are increasing. The Committee also notes concerns from stakeholders in this regard and urges the National Treasury to explicitly consider these issues in the budget and the budget process. The 2022 MTBPS included proposals for resources to fight corruption and crime over the medium- term. Over the next three years, SAPS will use funding allocated to the visible policing programme to strengthen its capacity to respond to gender-based violence. Over the same period, the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development is strengthening its focus on gender by establishing 109 sexual offences courts at designated courts and improving the management of the national register for sex offenders to ensure that all people working with vulnerable people are vetted. The department has allocated R27.5 million over the MTEF period to increase capacity in Thuthuzela care centres.

    "recommendation": "2023 Budget Review | 115 A multi-disciplinary effort under the leadership of the National Treasury is heavily focused on avoiding grey listing. As noted in the 2022 MTBPS, maintaining the integrity of South Africa’s financial system is critical to long-term growth. Government is addressing deficiencies in the anti- money laundering framework identified by the Financial Action Task Force. These changes are intended to reduce the risk and incidence of financial crime and corruption, and to avoid grey listing. Over the 2023 MTEF period, functions critical to the anti-money laundering regime, particularly in the law enforcement agencies and the Financial Intelligence Centre, will receive additional resources to carry out this work. The Committee is concerned that there appears to be lack of understanding of the future of the Gauteng e-tolls. While the public seems to believe that the e-tolls have been scrapped, clarification was provided that a new funding model was being proposed to fund the e-tolls. The Committee requires the Minister of Finance to provide a written response on this after adoption of this report. As announced in the 2022 MTBPS speech, government is taking over the costs associated with upgrading and maintaining phase 1 of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Programme from users. The new funding model for this system is the financing arrangements between national government and the Gauteng provincial government. This is not national government’s preferred option, and the policy position is that direct road user charges remain the most efficient, effective and equitable financing mechanism. The provincial government will contribute to the costs associated with this infrastructure investment. The Committee recommends, as it has in its previous reports, that the Public Procurement Bill be tabled in Parliament for processing. The Committee believes that delays in tabling and processing this Bill compromises transformation and localisation (procurement of locally produced goods.)

    "recommendation": "That the Minister of Finance, working with all stakeholders, ensures that National Treasury provides for a transparent process regarding fiscal support to SOCs [state-owned companies], reports should be made public, including the establishment of SOC governance framework with public reporting criteria that clearly defines detailed and precise profitability and non-financial objectives for transparency. The National Treasury provides quarterly updates to Parliament (Standard Chart of Accounts) on the broad-based financial performance of schedule 2 public entities. Small businesses are very important for economic development, recovery and employment creation. The Committee urges the Minister of Finance to substantially increase the budget of this Department of Small Business Development during the 2023 national budget. This will ensure that Department of Small Business Development plays its critical role in the economy. The Department of Small Business Development is allocated R8.1 billion over the next three years. Over the medium term, R2.7 billion has been allocated to the department’s Small Enterprise Development Agency to support small businesses. Additional support of R280 million over the MTEF period will be provided to small businesses through incentives provided by the department. The National Treasury will continue to review the budget of the department, including to identify opportunities for better prioritisation and improved efficiency. Economic transformation and Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment are Constitutional imperatives. We urge the Minister of Finance to announce funding in the 2023 national budget for this purpose. Government promotes economic transformation and empowerment through a range of policies, including incentive programmes dedicated to black-owned enterprises such as the Black Industrialists Scheme. The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition uses incentive programmes to encourage beneficiaries to procure their raw materials from black-owned businesses. The Industrial Development Corporation is facilitating funding amounting to R22 billion towards black industrialists by 2025/26. The National Empowerment Fund aims to disburse R4.7 billion by 2025/26 towards black-owned and women-owned businesses. Government uses public procurement policy to increase its spending on historically disadvantaged individuals. Furthermore, competition policy is aimed at unlocking opportunities for economic participation by historically disadvantaged individuals. ANNEXURE A REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT",

The National Treasury notes the recommendation. It is envisaged that the bill will be tabled in Parliament in March 2023 once all other legislative processes are finalised. Currently, the bill is undergoing legal vetting by the Office of the Chief State Law Adviser and a socioeconomic impact assessment by the Presidency. The National Treasury included a chapter on preferential procurement with enabling provisions covering locally manufactured goods and preferences in the allocation of contracts to support historically disadvantaged people. The Committee welcomes the extension of the SRD grant with one more year. However, to create certainty for the Department of Social Development and South African Social Security Agency, the Committee recommends the extension of SRD grant for the next three years while a permanent security programme is being finalised. The National Treasury notes the recommendation. Government is reviewing options for social protection alternatives to the grant. Further extensions of the grant need to be funded through spending reprioritisation, increased revenue or a combination of the two. The South African Post Office (SAPO) plays a crucial role in the economy of South Africa, especially among the poorest of the poor. There is a need for recapitalisation of SAPO and the Minister of Finance, in consultation with the Minister of Communication and Digital Technologies, should finalise the recapitalisation strategy and present this in the 2023 national budget. The South African Post Office was allocated a cumulative amount of over R7.3 billion between 2016/17 and 2018/19. Despite these equity injections, SAPO has not emerged from its present financial weakness. In this regard, the National Treasury has engaged with the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies to finalise a credible turnaround plan for the entity. In the meantime, a R2.4 billion allocation for the South African Post Office is included in the second adjustments appropriation bill tabled.",

The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure. The Minister of Finance, working with all affected stakeholders, ensures that National Treasury speedily releases disaster relief funding in order to minimise the social and economic impact of affected communities. The funds are released based on the payment schedule submitted by the responsible transferring officer and approved by the National Treasury. The National Treasury notes that the slow release of funds is due to poor internal processes within departments and ineffective intergovernmental cooperation. In this regard, disaster funds already allocated to departments need to be efficiently but judiciously released. The Minister of Finance ensures that National Treasury periodically audit how disaster relief funds are spent, and or whether these funds are efficiently utilised for the benefit of affected communities. Given the number of recent disasters and the funds allocated towards disaster relief, the Committee is concerned and doesn’t want to again be informed of any level of corruption like what was found during the COVID-19 related funding. Where there is a suspicion of corruption elements, National Treasury should quickly intervene and immediately report such to the law enforcement agencies. The National Treasury periodically monitors all funds transferred to subnational government. However, sector departments are responsible for both financial and non-financial monitoring of these funds and should intervene timeously if there is non-compliance. The authority to audit programmes lies with the Auditor-General of South Africa, who has already undertaken a series of special audits related to disaster relief.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ON THE ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL The Minister of Finance should gazette the proposed additional funding allocations, with clear conditions, as indicated in the Special Appropriation Bill [B24 – 2022], amounting to R23.7 billion for the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) for repayment of its maturing debt and debt- related obligations, R3.4 billion for Denel SOE Limited (Denel) for the implementation of its turnaround plan, and R2.9 billion for Transnet SOE Limited (Transnet) for the acceleration of the repair and maintenance of locomotives. The conditions have been shared with the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Chairperson of the Select Committee on Appropriations. The Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Minister of Transport, should ensure that the pre- and post-conditions prescribed for the bail-outs are fully complied with, and that clear consequences are explicitly outlined as part of such conditions; so that appropriate action will be taken against the transgressor in the case of non-compliance. Furthermore, the Committee is of the view that, in order to encourage transparency in public finances, any bail-out must have conditions that are publicly available for continuous accountability and oversight. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation and has set up oversight teams to monitor progress on the implementation of the bailout conditions. Spending that is inconsistent with the purpose of or the conditions associated with the allocations may be deemed irregular expenditure. In terms of sections 38 and 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, irregular expenditure may be deemed financial misconduct. The associated sanction in terms of the Public Finance Management Act and the Public Audit Act (2004) will apply in these circumstances. The Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Minister of Transport, should ensure that all additional funds earmarked for their respective departments are spent according to the approved plans and within the ambit of the Special Appropriation Bill [B24 – 2022], and ensure that clear internal controls and financial management systems are put in place to prevent poor, wasteful and fruitless expenditure, and that consequence management is enforced.

The National Treasury supports this recommendation. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, should ensure prompt response when disasters happen, including transfer of the much- needed funds earmarked for disaster relief; and ensure the effective spending of the additional R3.3 billion to the Municipal Disaster Recovery Grant for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure damaged by floods in the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu- Natal. The National Treasury shares concerns regarding the slow release of funds, and has referred this recommendation to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. Funds are only released after the affected provinces or municipalities have submitted applications as per the Disaster Management Act (2002). The grant conditions set out the planning and reporting requirements to assist in monitoring and reviewing the performance of the disaster recovery programme. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Human Settlements and the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, should expedite the process of relocating the victims of the April 2022 floods and disasters, which were residing in informal settlements in eThekwini. The Committee believes that the amendment of the framework of the Informal Settlements Upgrading Partnership Grant: Municipalities to ring-fence funds for the purchase of land identified for the relocation will assist to fast-track the process. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Minister of Human Settlements. The provincial department of human settlements and the municipality are responsible for implementing emergency housing programmes, as set out in the Housing Code. Given the impact of the recent floods, the Committee recommends that government should consider providing municipalities with performance-based conditional grants, rewarding or incentivising programmes that are environmentally efficient and responsive to the adaptation and mitigation of the challenges of climate change. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The Disaster Management Act requires all organs of state to prevent and mitigate disasters, and this is also considered when funding is made available to respond to a disaster. The National Treasury should correct the allocations and effect the required changes to the Municipal Disaster Recovery Grant (MDRG) framework to ensure that MDRG allocations are correctly allocated to the municipalities assigned for the function.

The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. Over the 2023 MTEF period, the National Treasury has allocated the full amounts requested by the National Prosecuting Authority (R1.3 billion) and the Special Investigating Unit (R100 million) to implement the recommendations of the State Capture Commission. SAPS is allocated R7.8 billion over the period to improve capacity in police stations. The National Treasury, together with its provincial counterparts, should ensure that mechanisms to continuously improve provincial conditional grant expenditure are implemented, as articulated in the conditional grant frameworks, to achieve value for money, particularly for the proposed additional grant funding earmarked through the Budget Facility for Infrastructure (BFI). These include funding for the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP) for KwaZulu-Natal, the Education Infrastructure Grant for Gauteng, the Provincial Roads Maintenance Grant for rural bridges, the National Health Insurance Indirect Grant for the Limpopo Central Hospital, as well as the Coega Development Corporation for water services in the Eastern Cape.

The National Treasury considers that internal management and political dysfunction are the key causes of the financial challenges in municipalities. In this regard, working with provincial treasuries and the Department of Cooperative Governance, the National Treasury continues to build financial capacity in municipalities and support municipalities in financial distress.

Secondly, government departments should be encouraged to use the services of state agencies and state owned companies.

    "recommendation": "2023 Budget Review | 107 PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TOURISM The National Treasury should appropriate a ring-fenced budget that will be used to develop, enhance and market domestic tourism which is a cornerstone for successful tourism destinations. The National Treasury continues to engage departments on funding-related issues during the annual budget process. To support the tourism sector’s recovery, the Department of Tourism has reprioritised R540 million over the 2022 MTEF period to establish the Tourism Equity Fund. The committee recommends that the National Treasury appropriates budget that will allow sector recovery and assists in surpassing the 2019 performance levels before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The committee made a similar recommendation in the 2022 Budget. The National Treasury will continue to engage the Department of Tourism on funding‐related issues during the annual budget process and support efforts to enable the recovery of the tourism sector. As noted, the Department of Tourism has reprioritised R540 million over the 2022 MTEF period to establish the Tourism Equity Fund and support the tourism sector’s recovery. In addition, the department is allocated R180 million over the next three years to support the piloting of the Tourism Equity Fund introduced in 2021. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS The committee expresses its disappointment with the Department of Defence not correctly spending the allocation of R225 million over the MTEF on border safeguarding technology. The committee recommends that the department reprioritises R140 million from its allocation for 2023/24 for the purpose of border safeguarding technology as force multipliers. Subject to this reprioritisation being carried out and spent successfully, the committee then recommends further ring-fenced allocations for border safeguarding technology by National Treasury for the outer years of the 2023 MTEF. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. The Department of Defence is allocated additional funding of R500 million in 2024/25 and R200 million in 2025/26 to procure equipment and technology to aid the safeguarding of borders. These earmarked funds may not be used for any other purposes. Any changes to these amounts will require the National Treasury’s approval. As in the Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans’ BRRR [budgetary review and recommendation report] recommendations to the National Treasury in 2019, 2020 and 2021, the committee again recommends a ring-fenced allocation for the midlife upgrades of the SA Navy frigates and submarines. The committee is suggesting a staggered approach in this regard to limit the fiscal impact, but one that would ensure the midlife upgrades of all frigates and submarines over, for example, the next 7 to 10 years, starting in 2023/24. This will allow the SA Navy to appropriately plan vessel availability, adjust its sea-hour targets accordingly and report more accurately to Parliament. It would also add significant capacity in terms of maritime security which is currently characterised by very limited naval patrols. Consistent with the committee’s recommendation, the Department of Defence is allocated additional funding of R500 million in 2023/24, R441 million in 2024/25 and R480 million in 2025/26 for the midlife upgrades of the South African Navy’s frigates and submarines.

Funds should be specifically made available for the appointment of IPID investigators to improve the ratio between police officers and IPID investigators. Due to the constrained fiscal outlook, there is limited scope to provide additional funding. The IPID has not demonstrated that it has the capacity to fully spend its allocated budget. Generally, the department underspends its budget for compensation of employees due to vacant funded posts. Accordingly, the IPID will need to demonstrate improved capacity to fill its vacant funded posts and reduce its underspending on compensation of employees before additional funding is considered. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT The Minister of Finance, through the National Treasury, should assist the Department of Transport and its entities, along with the Auditor General of South Africa, to obtain a definitive dented interpretation of decision of supply chain management terminology and issues raised with B-BBEE [broad-based black economic empowerment] compliance requirements in order to prevent future disputes during the audit process lined to these terms. The committee made a similar recommendation in the 2022 Budget. Accounting officers and executive authorities are responsible for managing their supply chains. In addition, the National Treasury provides support through toolkits. Departments and entities can leverage the courses and training programmes offered to familiarise themselves with the relevant subject matter and generally accepted definitions and terminologies. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer has dedicated officials that deal with queries from stakeholders and will continue to widely publish invitations for training that it offers. The process of getting B-BBEE certification lies outside the control of the National Treasury. The Minister of Finance should assist the Department of Transport in finalising a new feasibility study linked to the future of Moloto Rail Corridor and other high-speed rail corridors. The option of building a new railway line along the Moloto Corridor was explored in a feasibility study undertaken by the Department of Transport in 2015. The National Treasury’s evaluation of the feasibility study concluded that a railway link through the Moloto Corridor route would be unaffordable and unsustainable for both commuters and the fiscus. However, the feasibility study did provide grounds for improvements to the road infrastructure and transport services along the route, which has led to accelerated work on the Moloto development corridor. A more detailed response has also been provided to the Select Committee on Appropriation in its recommendation on the 2019 Division of Revenue Amendment Bill.

The National Treasury notes the committee’s recommendation. Over the medium term, the Department of Home Affairs will receive additional funding of R900 million for the Border Management Authority. In addition, R839.9 million is allocated in 2023/24 for the digitisation programme, of which R559.5 million is for compensation of employees and the remainder will be used to procure information and communications technology equipment and goods and services. The committee recommends that the current provision of services to clients on Saturdays and after 4pm should be revived and expanded by the Department of Home Affairs in negotiation with the National Treasury for funding and trade unions for staff interests prior to the end of the 2019/20 financial year. Consideration, in this regard should be given to the lost productive time for learners, businesses and employees as well as the essential nature of the services. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Department of Home Affairs. Funding requests from departments for specific projects are dealt with through the annual budget process and presented in Parliament for consideration. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION The National School of Government (NSG) together with the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) should continue to engage the National Treasury in exploring alternative funding methods to ensure that the NSG is self-sustainable in the future years. The School’s proposal should be allowed by the National Treasury and the Cabinet which seek government departments including local government to set aside a particular percentage of their training budget to fund the NSG training courses. The DPSA, in collaboration with the NSG, is consulting the National Treasury on developing a directive on compulsory training programmes for the public service. The National Treasury has commented on the draft directive and advised the DPSA and the NSG on the feasible funding mechanisms for the proposed training programmes. Furthermore, the National Treasury has highlighted the importance of formulating the provisions of the directive in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act (1999) on the powers and responsibilities of accounting officers and the requirements of the supply chain or procurement management system. The National Treasury has also highlighted the legislative processes or arrangements that need to be followed for the NSG to be accorded a sole training provider status. Through the annual budget process, the National Treasury will continue to work with the DPSA and the NSG as they develop training policy mechanisms and funding mechanisms for the NSG.

    "recommendation": "2022 MTBPS estimated that gross loan debt would stabilise and a primary budget surplus would be achieved in 2022/23, showing that fiscal policy is achieving its objectives. Nevertheless, risks to the fiscal outlook are substantial, including due to a rise in debt and likely effects of the takeover of Eskom debt as announced in the 2022 MTBPS. Chapter 3 discusses fiscal policy in more detail. While NT is adamant that the 2022 MTBPS, and the Budget in general, is pro-poor, more and more people are unemployed and are trapped in poverty and inequality. The Committee remains extremely concerned about this, especially in the light of an economic growth rate that is too low to address poverty, inequality and unemployment challenges. The Committee recommends that the Budget should consider far more the impact of the high cost of living on the economy, particularly on the poor households. The National Treasury notes the committee’s recommendation. It is important to note that fiscal policy alone cannot solve the challenges of poverty and unemployment. The economic outlook is determined by a variety of factors that are mostly not in the control of fiscal policies. Nevertheless, the 2023 Budget continues to allocate the majority of spending to the social wage, which supports poorer households. In addition, the combined impact of structural reforms, support for small business and new infrastructure investment will enable higher rates of growth and job creation over the long term. The Committee notes the submissions made by the stakeholders regarding increasing the social grants and is sympathetic to them. The Committee also welcomes the extension of the SRD [social relief of distress] grant by another year. Given the consequences of Covid-19, the July 2021 social unrest, the KZN floods and the increased poverty, inequality and job losses, the unemployed and poor need to be cushioned more. The Committee reiterates its previous position that the National Treasury and government should seriously consider a Basic Income Grant (BIG). The National Treasury, together with partner departments, is reviewing options to provide appropriate social protection measures for the working-age population that can replace or complement the current COVID-19 social relief of distress grant. Any permanent increase in expenditure, such as a new social grant, will need to be matched by permanent revenue increases or spending reductions elsewhere. While the National Treasury expects gross loan debt to stabilise at 71.4 per cent of GDP in 2022/23, which is two years earlier and at a lower level than projected in the 2022 Budget Review, the Committee remains concerned about the high levels of the debt. The Committee reiterates its recommendation that the National Treasury reports quarterly to it on the effectiveness of its debt management strategies that would ensure that the level of debt stabilises over the medium term as ANNEXURE A REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT",

    "recommendation": "that the National Treasury confirmed that the risks previously identified in the 2022 Budget have already materialised. The continued bailout of SOEs [state-owned enterprises] undermines government’s fiscal stabilisation efforts. The Committee recommends that the bailing out of SOEs, which is one of the biggest risks to the fiscus, should be subject to stringent conditions and accountability measures. In this regard, the Committee notes the proposed conditional allocations to public entities such as Denel, SANRAL and Transnet in order to reduce contingent liabilities and enable these entities to continue supporting economic growth. The Committee recommends a similar approach as far as possible be taken on all SOE bail-outs. The National Treasury agrees with these recommendations. Chapter 8 discusses the new framework for state-owned companies, which will support the implementation of these recommendations. The Committee further recommends that the National Treasury should consider South African Institute of Chartered Accountants [SAICA] and Financial and Fiscal Commission [FFC] recommendations on SOEs, which include a focus on operational deficiencies and proper management of procurement, contracts and payments, a risk-based approach to government guarantees and that a differentiation be made between repair and maintenance spending versus funding for new infrastructure.

    "recommendation": "that could be implemented, within the constitutional and legislative mandate of SARB, which would not involve the aggressive hiking of the repo rate. Stable fiscal policy is a necessary condition for reducing pressure on monetary policy, particularly in a small open economy such as South Africa. At the same time, it is not a sufficient condition for eliminating it altogether. The National Treasury, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, sets the inflation target, which acts as a benchmark against which price stability is measured. The Reserve Bank then independently sets monetary policy to achieve this target. Fiscal policy and monetary policy both contribute to a stable macroeconomic framework to support investment, economic growth and job creation. The Reserve Bank considers many factors in its decision-making process. Fiscal policy remains focused on stabilising public debt and ensuring sustainable public finances in support of macroeconomic stability. At the same time, government enables economic and social development by maintaining a prudent fiscal stance, directing resources towards infrastructure, contributing to energy reforms and supporting the social wage. In the 2022 Budget Speech in February, the Minister of Finance stated that he had agreed with the Minister of Minerals and Energy to review all aspects of the fuel price. The Committee further notes and welcomes the fuel levy relief announced by the two Ministers in March and May 2022, with the aim of alleviating pressure of the rising fuel costs on households. The Committee requires that the Minister of Finance reports back to it on progress made in reviewing all aspects of the fuel price regime. The Minister of Finance has committed to reviewing the Road Accident Fund levy. The recommendation has been referred to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, which is responsible for reviewing the fuel price. The Committee notes that the 2022 MTBPS does not appear to have explicitly budgeted for fighting corruption and Gender Based Violence (GBV) while the levels of crime in the country are increasing. The Committee also notes concerns from stakeholders in this regard and urges the National Treasury to explicitly consider these issues in the budget and the budget process. The 2022 MTBPS included proposals for resources to fight corruption and crime over the medium- term. Over the next three years, SAPS will use funding allocated to the visible policing programme to strengthen its capacity to respond to gender-based violence. Over the same period, the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development is strengthening its focus on gender by establishing 109 sexual offences courts at designated courts and improving the management of the national register for sex offenders to ensure that all people working with vulnerable people are vetted. The department has allocated R27.5 million over the MTEF period to increase capacity in Thuthuzela care centres.

    "recommendation": "2023 Budget Review | 115 A multi-disciplinary effort under the leadership of the National Treasury is heavily focused on avoiding grey listing. As noted in the 2022 MTBPS, maintaining the integrity of South Africa’s financial system is critical to long-term growth. Government is addressing deficiencies in the anti- money laundering framework identified by the Financial Action Task Force. These changes are intended to reduce the risk and incidence of financial crime and corruption, and to avoid grey listing. Over the 2023 MTEF period, functions critical to the anti-money laundering regime, particularly in the law enforcement agencies and the Financial Intelligence Centre, will receive additional resources to carry out this work. The Committee is concerned that there appears to be lack of understanding of the future of the Gauteng e-tolls. While the public seems to believe that the e-tolls have been scrapped, clarification was provided that a new funding model was being proposed to fund the e-tolls. The Committee requires the Minister of Finance to provide a written response on this after adoption of this report. As announced in the 2022 MTBPS speech, government is taking over the costs associated with upgrading and maintaining phase 1 of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Programme from users. The new funding model for this system is the financing arrangements between national government and the Gauteng provincial government. This is not national government’s preferred option, and the policy position is that direct road user charges remain the most efficient, effective and equitable financing mechanism. The provincial government will contribute to the costs associated with this infrastructure investment. The Committee recommends, as it has in its previous reports, that the Public Procurement Bill be tabled in Parliament for processing. The Committee believes that delays in tabling and processing this Bill compromises transformation and localisation (procurement of locally produced goods.)

The National Treasury provides quarterly updates to Parliament (Standard Chart of Accounts) on the broad-based financial performance of schedule 2 public entities. Small businesses are very important for economic development, recovery and employment creation. The Committee urges the Minister of Finance to substantially increase the budget of this Department of Small Business Development during the 2023 national budget. This will ensure that Department of Small Business Development plays its critical role in the economy. The Department of Small Business Development is allocated R8.1 billion over the next three years. Over the medium term, R2.7 billion has been allocated to the department’s Small Enterprise Development Agency to support small businesses. Additional support of R280 million over the MTEF period will be provided to small businesses through incentives provided by the department. The National Treasury will continue to review the budget of the department, including to identify opportunities for better prioritisation and improved efficiency. Economic transformation and Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment are Constitutional imperatives. We urge the Minister of Finance to announce funding in the 2023 national budget for this purpose. Government promotes economic transformation and empowerment through a range of policies, including incentive programmes dedicated to black-owned enterprises such as the Black Industrialists Scheme. The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition uses incentive programmes to encourage beneficiaries to procure their raw materials from black-owned businesses. The Industrial Development Corporation is facilitating funding amounting to R22 billion towards black industrialists by 2025/26. The National Empowerment Fund aims to disburse R4.7 billion by 2025/26 towards black-owned and women-owned businesses.

Given the number of recent disasters and the funds allocated towards disaster relief, the Committee is concerned and doesn’t want to again be informed of any level of corruption like what was found during the COVID-19 related funding. Where there is a suspicion of corruption elements, National Treasury should quickly intervene and immediately report such to the law enforcement agencies. The National Treasury periodically monitors all funds transferred to subnational government. However, sector departments are responsible for both financial and non-financial monitoring of these funds and should intervene timeously if there is non-compliance. The authority to audit programmes lies with the Auditor-General of South Africa, who has already undertaken a series of special audits related to disaster relief. The Minister of Basic Education ensures that the Department of Basic Education closely monitor the reconstruction and rehabilitation of public schools that were affected by the December 2021 and April 2022 in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ON THE ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL The Minister of Finance should gazette the proposed additional funding allocations, with clear conditions, as indicated in the Special Appropriation Bill [B24 – 2022], amounting to R23.7 billion for the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) for repayment of its maturing debt and debt- related obligations, R3.4 billion for Denel SOE Limited (Denel) for the implementation of its turnaround plan, and R2.9 billion for Transnet SOE Limited (Transnet) for the acceleration of the repair and maintenance of locomotives. The conditions have been shared with the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Chairperson of the Select Committee on Appropriations. The Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Minister of Transport, should ensure that the pre- and post-conditions prescribed for the bail-outs are fully complied with, and that clear consequences are explicitly outlined as part of such conditions; so that appropriate action will be taken against the transgressor in the case of non-compliance. Furthermore, the Committee is of the view that, in order to encourage transparency in public finances, any bail-out must have conditions that are publicly available for continuous accountability and oversight. The National Treasury agrees with the recommendation and has set up oversight teams to monitor progress on the implementation of the bailout conditions. Spending that is inconsistent with the purpose of or the conditions associated with the allocations may be deemed irregular expenditure. In terms of sections 38 and 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, irregular expenditure may be deemed financial misconduct. The associated sanction in terms of the Public Finance Management Act and the Public Audit Act (2004) will apply in these circumstances. The Minister of Finance, together with the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Minister of Transport, should ensure that all additional funds earmarked for their respective departments are spent according to the approved plans and within the ambit of the Special Appropriation Bill [B24 – 2022], and ensure that clear internal controls and financial management systems are put in place to prevent poor, wasteful and fruitless expenditure, and that consequence management is enforced.

The National Treasury, together with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, should ensure prompt response when disasters happen, including transfer of the much- needed funds earmarked for disaster relief; and ensure the effective spending of the additional R3.3 billion to the Municipal Disaster Recovery Grant for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure damaged by floods in the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu- Natal. The National Treasury shares concerns regarding the slow release of funds, and has referred this recommendation to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. Funds are only released after the affected provinces or municipalities have submitted applications as per the Disaster Management Act (2002). The grant conditions set out the planning and reporting requirements to assist in monitoring and reviewing the performance of the disaster recovery programme. The National Treasury, together with the Department of Human Settlements and the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, should expedite the process of relocating the victims of the April 2022 floods and disasters, which were residing in informal settlements in eThekwini. The Committee believes that the amendment of the framework of the Informal Settlements Upgrading Partnership Grant: Municipalities to ring-fence funds for the purchase of land identified for the relocation will assist to fast-track the process. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Minister of Human Settlements. The provincial department of human settlements and the municipality are responsible for implementing emergency housing programmes, as set out in the Housing Code. Given the impact of the recent floods, the Committee recommends that government should consider providing municipalities with performance-based conditional grants, rewarding or incentivising programmes that are environmentally efficient and responsive to the adaptation and mitigation of the challenges of climate change. The National Treasury has referred this recommendation to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The Disaster Management Act requires all organs of state to prevent and mitigate disasters, and this is also considered when funding is made available to respond to a disaster. The National Treasury should correct the allocations and effect the required changes to the Municipal Disaster Recovery Grant (MDRG) framework to ensure that MDRG allocations are correctly allocated to the municipalities assigned for the function.

The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. Over the 2023 MTEF period, the National Treasury has allocated the full amounts requested by the National Prosecuting Authority (R1.3 billion) and the Special Investigating Unit (R100 million) to implement the recommendations of the State Capture Commission.

The SARB and the Prudential Authority are audited by private auditors. The development banks audited are the Land and Agricultural Development Bank of South Africa (LB) and the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). The audited government agencies are the Government Technical and Advisory Centre (GTAC) and the Government Pension and Administration Agency. The insurance and investment companies are the Public Investment Corporation, Land Bank Insurance SOC, and the Land Bank Life Insurance SOC Limited (LBLIC).

The Committee offers these observations and recommendations:  Regarding the Township Economic Development Strategies: the nearly met target (4 out of 5 strategies executed) calls for identifying and resolving the obstacles that hindered the fifth strategy's rollout, ensuring all-inclusive economic upliftment in the designated townships.  Concerning the Cabinet Memos: the 97% achievement rate underscores operational efficacy but also highlights areas to enhance responsiveness and expedite processing to address all memos promptly.  In the case of Grant Funding: disbursement fell short (R6.465 billion of the anticipated R6.953 billion), signalling a necessity to refine the allocation processes and eliminate any hindrances to guarantee the full disbursement of the earmarked grant funds.  On Draft Financial Recovery Plans (FRPs): the 0% attainment demands immediate intervention to bolster responsiveness and assist entities needing FRPs, crucial for fiscal equilibrium and efficient service provision. The lag in developing and overseeing FRPs, coupled with the incomplete assignment of technical advisors, can potentially stall the financial recuperation of beleaguered municipalities. 14.34. Programme 4 exhibited notable success in asset and liability management, attaining 92.31% of its objectives but encountered hurdles in a segment of the PFMA applications review. Efforts should now concentrate on bridging this identified gap. 14.35. By employing focused strategies, integrating technology, and maintaining ongoing oversight, Programme 4 is well-positioned to refine its efficacy in managing assets and liabilities, thereby supporting overarching fiscal and economic stability goals. 14.36. Programme 5 demonstrated varied performance, achieving 69.24% of its targets but falling short in certain areas, including the incomplete placement of technical advisors in municipalities and the underdevelopment of the IFMS and e-Recruitment systems. 14.37. The Committee urges NT to pinpoint and rectify obstacles impeding the full execution of the strategic sourcing opportunities plan and refine the process of deploying technical advisors. 14.38. Additionally, NT should identify and address the issues hampering the progression of IFMS and e-Recruitment systems and formulate a detailed action plan to accelerate these pivotal projects. 14.39. Programme 6 has excelled in international financial relations. The Committee recommends elevating the quality and impact of engagements and policy developments. By focusing on continual enhancement, stakeholder collaboration, and adaptive approaches, this programme can strengthen global financial ties, aiding South Africa's economic and developmental goals. 14.40. Programme 7 achieved all its targets for the 2022/23 period, demonstrating effective management of civil and military pensions and other benefits. To maintain this excellence, the focus should be on innovation, technology integration, and improved beneficiary engagement to adapt to emerging challenges and demands, ensuring continued responsive and efficient service delivery. 14.41. Regarding human capital, the Committee observes that NT monitors various indicators, such as workforce diversity, vacancy rates, promotions, and skills development participation. With a 16",

    "recommendation": "that 13 cases have reached the National Prosecuting Authority, signalling SARS' commitment to accountability and legal compliance. The Committee mandates quarterly updates from SARS to ensure transparency and progress tracking and is committed to providing Parliament with consistent quarterly reports on the advancement of implementing the Commissions‟ recommendations. 14.59. The Committee highlights the uplift in satisfaction levels among taxpayers and traders to 75.3%, up from 69.1%. This upswing reflects SARS's efforts in demystifying tax obligations and promoting easier compliance. A 90.3% satisfaction rate among intermediaries and a significant improvement in the public opinion survey score to 76.5%, up from 71.8%, underscore enhanced public confidence and satisfaction. 14.60. To build on this momentum, the Committee recommends intensified initiatives to elevate these satisfaction rates even higher, through enhanced communication, outreach and support mechanisms tailored to meet the diverse needs of taxpayers and traders. 14.61. The Committee appreciates SARS‟ progressive strides in digital transformation, highlighted by an 89.4% usage rate of digital and self-help platforms. This indicates a significant move towards simplifying and enhancing the tax compliance process. The upward trend in auto assessments acceptance is a testimony to the efficacy and convenience brought about by these digital initiatives. 14.62. SARS‟s ongoing innovations are pivotal, and the Committee encourages the continual refinement of digital platforms to ensure they are tailored to the users, secure, and streamlined. This will not only optimize the taxpayer experience but also fortify compliance mechanisms. 14.63. The integration of Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) as an additional service channel is particularly commended. It underscores SARS‟s commitment to diversifying access points, enhancing convenience, and ensuring that tax services are within easy reach for all taxpayers, including those with limited internet access. The Committee is optimistic that these digital advancements will contribute significantly to a more efficient, accessible, and responsive tax administration system. 14.64. While the Committee commends SARS on its digital advancements, it emphasizes the equal importance of catering to those with limited technological access, means and skills. Earlier concerns were raised about individuals being turned away due to the lack of online appointments. 14.65. The Committee reiterates and stresses the imperative of SARS maintaining its accessibility to every citizen, ensuring that digital innovations do not inadvertently exclude those with limited digital access and literacy. Physical offices, adaptations and support systems should be in place to ensure inclusivity in service provision, bridging the digital divide while enhancing overall service efficiency. 14.66. The Committee takes positive note of the remarkable strides made by SARS in compliance enforcement and service delivery. The precision of SARS‟s automated risk engines, which accurately identified over 96% of compliance risks, preventing over R70 billion in impermissible refunds, attests to the effectiveness of the agency's risk management systems. 14.67. The Committee further notes the commendable 98% conviction rate achieved through the NPA, underscoring the synergy between enforcement and judicial processes, ensuring that violators face stringent legal consequences. This high conviction rate amplifies the credibility and effectiveness of SARS‟s enforcement mechanisms, instilling confidence in the integrity of South Africa‟s tax and customs systems. 18",

The Minister of Finance should ensure that that the DoD is sufficiently funded for all additional deployment requirements and provide the committee with information on how this deployment will be funded.

Final allocation decisions on CARA are made by Cabinet and thereafter communicated to qualifying departments. An amount of R150 million over three years has been earmarked for the Department of Defence within CARA to support this deployment. Before this deployment, the Department of Defence was made aware that funding related to this deployment would be strictly funded by CARA and not the fiscus. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND CORRECTIONAL SERVICES The importance of Legal Aid SA’s contribution to the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system should be taken into account when allocations are made.

Furthermore, the baseline reduction of R250 million in 2024/25 outlined in the 2023 MTBPS has been reversed. PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PLANNING, MONITORING AND EVALUATION The National Treasury should increase funding of the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) in order to build research and development and modelling capabilities. The DPME has underspent its allocated budget in recent years (by R12.8 million in 2020/21, R62.5 million in 2021/22 and R38.8 million in 2022/23), so it has scope to reprioritise funds to build research and development capabilities. The National Treasury should increase funding for Brand South Africa. The National Treasury notes the committee’s recommendation and advises reprioritisation to fund spending pressures and emerging priorities. The National Treasury further notes recommendations from the Portfolio Committee on Tourism to address duplication and inefficiency by merging the functions of Brand SA with at least one other relevant entity. STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE The committee commends the South African Revenue Service (SARS) for its exemplary fiscal discipline, demonstrated by the efficient allocation and utilisation of its entire budget for two consecutive years. The committee also acknowledge the ongoing issue of underfunding facing SARS and reiterate our call for the National Treasury to consider augmenting SARS’ resources. The National Treasury will continue to engage with SARS on its funding challenges. An additional amount of R500 million per year over the 2023 MTEF period was added to SARS’ budget to fund its capital and information and communications technology projects. In addition, R1 billion was provided to SARS during the 2023 adjustments budget process to improve its revenue‐raising capabilities. A further R1 billion per year in 2024/25 and 2025/26 is allocated to SARS depending on its ability to meet the set conditions. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STANDING AND SELECT COMMITTEES ON FINANCE ON THE 2023 REVISED AND PROPOSED FISCAL FRAMEWORK Recognizing the impact of structural constraints on economic growth, the Committee strongly recommends the swift implementation of energy and logistics improvements, encompassing comprehensive measures to overcome challenges in these critical sectors and unlock their potential for economic development. The National Treasury agrees with this recommendation. In expressing concern over the performance of SOEs, particularly Transnet and Eskom, the Committee recommends that NT, together with the Department of Public Enterprises, share detailed turnaround strategies for these entities before the tabling of the 2024 Budget. The Committee will confer with the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises for the feasibility of a joint meeting. ANNEXURE A REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT",

NT’s 2023/24 Annual Performance Report highlights a mix of achievements and challenges across its programmes. The report underscores a generally positive performance, with specific areas of improvement required in several programmes. 3.5. Programme 1: Administration achieved 100% of its non-financial targets, showcasing strong internal management and governance. Notably, the Treasury exceeded its ICT service delivery standard by achieving a 94% compliance rate, above the 93% target. Additionally, risk management reached level 5 maturity, indicating a robust control environment. 3.6. Furthermore, training and development surpassed expectations, with a 96% spend on this area, against a planned 70%, showing commitment to workforce development. The Administration programme had a projected expenditure of R609.9 million but concluded with an actual spend of R486.2 million, leading to a notable variance of R123.7 million. This represents only 80% of the budgeted amount. 3.7. Programme 2: Economic Policy, Tax, and Research also met all its targets, demonstrating progress in policy formulation and economic research. Treasury produced 30 research papers and nine macro/microeconomic reports, exceeding its target of eight. In addition, financial and tax legislation was successfully submitted to Parliament, a key achievement that aligns with Treasury’s legislative obligations. Financially, this programme utilized 92% of its allocated R138.4 million, recording avariance of R10.9 million with an actual expenditure of R127.5 million. 3.8. Programme 3: Public Finance and Budget Management showed mixed results, achieving 66.67% of its targets. The Treasury disbursed R7.19 billion in grant funding, falling slightly short of the R7.35 billion target. However, it excelled in infrastructure oversight by assessing 100% of infrastructure plans and approving 40 catalytic projects, exceeding the target of 35. Some variances were recorded, primarily due to the under-disbursement of funds related to the Common Monetary Area and delays in certain project rollouts, which impacted overall expenditure. The programme demonstrated close adherence to budget, achieving 99% utilization by spending R3.98 billion against its R4.00 billion target, yielding a minor variance of R26.1 million. 3.9. Programme 4: Asset and Liability Management successfully achieved 100% of its targets, reflecting effective fiscal stability and efficient management of the public debt portfolio. The programme conducted timely reviews of corporate plans from public entities and met the annual gross borrowing requirement, reinforcing its role in safeguarding South Africa’s financial health. Budget utilization was efficiently managed, with expenditures aligning well with allocated resources, which contributed to maintaining fiscal stability within the set budget framework. This programme reached full budget compliance, spending R656.4 million against a projected R657.7 million, with only a slight variance of R1.3 million. 3.10. Programme 5: Financial Accounting and Supply Chain Management Systems presented a more challenging performance, meeting only 54.55% of its targets. Key targets, such as the implementation of the e-Recruitment module and the Integrated Financial Management System, encountered delays. However, the programme achieved some of its supply chain and financial reporting goals, including successful production of transversal term contracts. In Financial 3",

The Centre successfully implemented all 30 United Nations Security Council designation amendments within 24 hours of publication, demonstrating compliance with South Africa’s international obligations on financial sanctions. 4.43. During 2024/25, the FIC and supervisory partners conducted 556 inspections across accountable institutions, of which 288 (52 percent) were based on risk and compliance return analysis. The Centre received 9,281 risk management and compliance returns, including 19,512 Directive 6 and 4,844 Directive 7 submissions. Enforcement actions during the year resulted in total sanctions and penalties of R2.23 million imposed by the FIC, including R782,000 in sanctions, R266,000 arising from 2023/24 appeal decisions, and R1.18 million for non-compliance. In comparison, the South African Reserve Bank’s Prudential Authority imposed R143.65 million, and the FSCA R7.4 million in penalties for sector-related violations. 4.44. In financial performance terms, the FIC’s total expenditure amounted to R442.1 million for 2024/25. Of this, personnel costs totalled R247.7 million (56 percent), operating costs R170.5 million (39 percent), and capital expenditure R23.9 million (5 percent). Expenditure by programme reflected R218.8 million (52 percent) for service delivery, R104.6 million (25 percent) for business enablement, and R94.6 million (23 percent) for administration. 4.45. The FIC played a central role in South Africa’s successful removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in October 2025. The Centre coordinated technical assistance, monitored implementation of 22 FATF action items, and hosted the on-site assessment visit by the FATF review team. 11",

The Authority invested R17.8 million in staff development, with 212 employees completing compliance and leadership training. 4.58. The FSCA’s IT Transformation Programme, initiated in 2023, achieved 88 percent completion by March 2025, including rollout of the new e-Licensing Portal, migration of supervisory systems to a cloud-based data environment, and the implementation of an AI-assisted case management system. System availability remained at 99.6 percent, with no major cybersecurity breaches reported. 4.59. On governance and compliance, the FSCA Board met 11 times during the year, maintaining full quorum in all statutory meetings. The Risk Committee reviewed 17 enterprise risks, including systemic conduct risks in the insurance and savings sectors. The Internal Audit Unit achieved 93 percent implementation of its audit coverage plan and reported no significant control weaknesses. 4.60. The FSCA’s consumer protection function handled 33,765 complaints, of which 82 percent were resolved within prescribed timelines. Top categories included unauthorised debit orders (22 percent), insurance claims (19 percent), and investment product misrepresentation (14 percent). The Authority’s new Online Complaint Management System, launched in December 2024, reduced case turnaround time by 37 percent. 4.61. The Financial Sector Transformation Council (FSTC), supported by the FSCA, approved its 2024/25 transformation scorecard methodology. Early findings indicated that 37 percent of institutions had achieved Level 4 or better on B-BBEE ratings, while microfinance institutions and fintech players lagged in compliance, prompting targeted transformation interventions. 4.62. As part of its international obligations, the FSCA represented South Africa at the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and Financial Stability Board (FSB) meetings, contributing to workstreams on digital assets regulation, sustainability disclosures, and climate-risk management. South Africa’s regulatory framework was rated as “largely compliant” in the IMF– World Bank FSAP 2024 assessment, with the FSCA commended for proactive supervision and enforcement capacity. 4.63. The FSCA’s balance sheet remained strong, with total assets of R1.52 billion, liabilities of R563 million, and accumulated surpluses of R957 million. Cash reserves stood at R421 million, ensuring sufficient liquidity for operational and capital expenditure in 2025/26. 4.64. Looking ahead to 2025/26, the FSCA will prioritise: implementing of the COFI framework once enacted and harmonising sectoral conduct rules, finalisation of the Transformation Strategy Framework and measurement tool for financial inclusion, expansion of the regulatory sandbox to cover crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and insurtechs, and enhancement of data analytics for proactive supervision of systemic conduct risks. PRUDENTIAL AUTHORITY PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW (2024/25) 4.65. The Prudential Authority (PA) is a regulatory body established under the Financial Sector Regulation Act, 2017, operating within the administration of the South African Reserve Bank. Its mandate is to promote and maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions that provide financial products and services, and to protect financial customers against systemic risks. The PA’s work is guided by the Twin Peaks model, functioning alongside the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) as part of the broader financial sector regulatory framework. 4.66. During the 2024/25 financial year, the PA achieved 92 percent of its key performance indicators (12 of 13 targets), maintaining strong regulatory oversight across the banking, insurance, and financial conglomerate sectors. The Authority received an unqualified audit opinion with no material findings, marking the fifth consecutive clean audit. 4.67. The Authority’s total revenue for 2024/25 amounted to R1.96 billion, up from R1.84 billion in 2023/24, representing a 6.5 percent year-on-year increase mainly due to higher levies collected from regulated entities and interest income. Total expenditure amounted to R1.93 billion, yielding a surplus of R31.8 million, compared to a deficit of R22.4 million in 2023/24. The improved financial performance was attributed to savings on professional fees and enhanced cost containment on administrative expenses. 4.68. The PA’s regulatory coverage included 33 registered banks, 45 insurers, 6 reinsurers, 11 cooperative banks, 16 conglomerate groups, and 28 financial market infrastructures. Supervisory reviews were conducted on all systemically important financial institutions, while thematic reviews focused on climate-related financial risks, cyber resilience, and Basel III liquidity compliance.

The Ombud emphasised that the sharp rise in complaints reflected improved public trust in dispute resolution mechanisms and greater awareness of consumer rights, rather than an increase in industry misconduct. The Office continued to support the Ombud Council in harmonising standards and improving coordination among financial ombud schemes. 4.104. The FAIS Ombud’s priorities for the forthcoming year include enhancing digital complaint management systems, strengthening cooperation with the Ombud Council and industry bodies, and expanding access for consumers in underserved regions through online and mobile complaint submission platforms. OFFICE OF THE PENSION FUNDS ADJUDICATOR OVERVIEW (2024/25) 4.105. The Office of the Pension Funds Adjudicator (OPFA) is a statutory ombud scheme established in terms of the Pension Funds Act, 1956 (Act No. 24 of 1956), with the mandate to resolve pension fund–related complaints in a fair, economical, and expeditious manner as provided under section 30D of the Act. The OPFA provides free and accessible dispute-resolution services, issuing determinations that carry the same enforceability as High Court orders. Its jurisdiction excludes the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF), Transnet Pension Fund, Post Office Pension Fund, and Associated Institutions Pension Fund (AIPF). 4.106. For the 2024/25 financial year, the OPFA recorded significant improvements in operational efficiency and service delivery. The Office received 10,331 new complaints, compared with 9,177 in 2023/24, representing a 12.6 percent increase year-on-year. The increase was attributed to greater public awareness and the anticipated surge in queries related to the Two-Pot Retirement System, which came into effect in September 2024. Of these, 10,100 complaints were finalised, reflecting a 97.8 percent case finalisation rate, up from 96 percent in the previous financial year. 4.107. The Office achieved 100 percent of its 14 key performance indicators, including the 93 percent of complaints finalised within six months, exceeding its target of 85 percent. The average resolution time continued to improve due to enhanced case management systems and an effective triage process between the New Complaints Unit (NCU), Early Resolution Unit (ER), and Case Management Teams 1 to 3. 4.108. The Auditor-General issued a clean audit opinion for the tenth consecutive year, confirming that the OPFA maintained sound financial controls, accurate reporting, and full compliance with the PFMA. The Office also achieved 100 percent compliance with the legislative requirement to pay suppliers within 30 days, reinforcing its financial discipline and operational integrity. 4.109. The OPFA’s case statistics revealed persistent patterns in the nature of complaints. The majority related to section 13A non-compliance, which covers employer failures to register employees, pay contributions on time, or contribute at the prescribed rate. Such non-compliance affects fund credits, withdrawal, retirement, disability, and death benefits. Other common complaints involved withdrawal benefits, death benefits, retirement annuities, and benefit statements. 4.110. The Top 10 funds most frequently cited for section 13A and withdrawal-benefit complaints included the Private Security Sector Provident Fund, Contract Cleaning National Provident Fund, Transport 17",

The IRBA achieved 13 of 14 performance indicators (93 percent). The only unmet target was under Operational Effectiveness, related to the delayed implementation of an enterprise resource-planning (ERP) module. All other divisions, Standards, Education and Transformation, Inspections, Investigations, and Disciplinary, achieved 100 percent of their key performance indicators. 4.126. Looking forward, the 2026–2030 Strategic Plan prioritises strengthening the audit-profession pipeline, accelerating digital transformation, enhancing collaboration with the National Treasury and Parliament, and advocating for regulatory reforms to align with evolving international auditing standards. The IRBA also aims to improve audit-quality outcomes beyond the current 45 percent benchmark and continue restoring public confidence in the auditing profession. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW (2024/25) 4.127. The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) is established in terms of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999). Its statutory mandate is to determine generally recognised accounting practice (GRAP) for all spheres of government, ensure consistency in public sector financial reporting, and promote transparency, accountability, and effective management of public resources. 4.128. For the 2024/25 financial year, the ASB achieved 10 out of 14 annual performance targets, equivalent to a 71 percent achievement rate, compared to 86 percent in the previous year. The unachieved targets were primarily linked to capacity shortages, delays in stakeholder consultation, and the re-exposure of certain accounting pronouncements. Despite these challenges, the Board maintained its unbroken record of clean audits since inception, with the Auditor-General confirming an unqualified opinion with no findings and no instances of unauthorised, irregular, fruitless, or wasteful expenditure. 4.129. The ASB’s approved budget for the 2024/25 year was R14.83 million, funded primarily through a transfer from National Treasury. Actual revenue amounted to R15.29 million, comprising R14.64 19",

This necessitated the use of interest income and internal reserves to maintain liquidity and meet payment obligations. The entity also absorbed delays in client payments to ensure suppliers were paid within statutory deadlines, which further strained its operational budget. 4.145. Employee compensation costs accounted for R75 million, and GTAC confirmed that it continued to subsidise late client payments to maintain operational continuity. The management proposed that clients consider prepayment mechanisms to improve cash flow management and mitigate future funding shortfalls. 4.146. GTAC sustained its record of clean audits and high performance across its service portfolio. It remained a key technical partner to government in public finance reform, infrastructure advisory, and institutional strengthening. The Centre’s multi-disciplinary expertise and collaborative approach positioned it as an essential enabler of the state’s capability agenda. 4.147. Looking forward, GTAC’s focus areas include expanding partnerships for infrastructure delivery, improving cost-recovery systems, enhancing its digital Knowledge Hub, and strengthening technical advisory capabilities. The Centre also aims to scale up its contribution to the National Infrastructure Plan (NIP 2050) and continue driving innovation in project management and expenditure reviews to improve value for money across government. DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SOUTHERN AFRICA OVERVIEW (2024/25) 4.148. The Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) operates under the DBSA Act, 1997 (Act No. 13 of 1997), with the statutory mandate to promote economic development and growth, build human and institutional capacity, and support sustainable development projects and programmes in South Africa and across the African continent. The Bank is wholly owned by the South African Government and plays a key role in financing and implementing infrastructure and development projects aligned with national priorities. 4.149. The DBSA’s total infrastructure development support reached R91.3 billion for the year ended 31 March 2025, compared to R72.9 billion in 2023/24, representing a 25.2 percent increase. This amount included R17.5 billion in disbursements, exceeding the annual target of R14.5 billion by 18 21",

The Bank’s debt-to-equity ratio improved to 78 percent (2024: 89 percent), while the net interest margin (NIM) increased to 7.3 percent (2024: 7.2 percent). The capital-to-unweighted assets ratio stood at 48 percent, compared to 44 percent in the prior year, well above the regulatory minimum stipulated under the DBSA Act. Liquidity also strengthened, with total holdings rising to R15.02 billion, up from R10.8 billion in March 2024. 4.153. On governance and compliance, the DBSA maintained its unqualified audit opinion for the 2024/25 financial year, continuing its record of unbroken clean audits since inception. No irregular, unauthorised, or fruitless and wasteful expenditure was incurred, and all PFMA submissions were processed within the stipulated deadlines. The Bank retained its external credit ratings of Ba3 (Moody’s) and BB– (S&P), as well as an AA rating from the Association of African Development Finance Institutions (AADFI). 4.154. Development impact metrics indicated a substantial contribution to South Africa’s socio-economic development. During the year, the DBSA facilitated 37,099 jobs, surpassing the target of 24,000; supported 11,231 small, medium, and micro-enterprises (SMMEs), and trained 1,643 youth, with 36,102 learners benefiting from social infrastructure interventions. A total of R4.8 billion in SMME funding was disbursed, of which R2.6 billion was allocated to black women–owned entities, reflecting progress in empowerment and gender transformation. 4.155. The Bank’s developmental operations extended to under-resourced municipalities, where R2.6 billion in infrastructure was unlocked (target: R1.8 billion). In district municipalities, R838 million worth of infrastructure was financed (target: R300 million). DBSA also advanced the just energy transition agenda, with R1.6 billion approved for climate and environmental facility projects (target: R500 million). 4.156. The DBSA’s project preparation and infrastructure delivery units were instrumental in enabling major national and regional projects. Key case studies included the Embedded Generation Investment Programme (EGIP), a renewable energy portfolio of 1,100 MW with a total investment of R7.2 billion; R4 billion in municipal funding under the Integrated Municipal Approach; USD 68 million invested in the Geothermal Energy Project in Kenya; USD 20 million in a multi-country Infrastructure Acceleration Fund; and R6.85 billion in bulk water schemes across South Africa. 4.157. Among its flagship infrastructure initiatives, the Bank financed the Kazungula Water and Sanitation Project (EUR 11.9 million, completed June 2025, benefitting 20,000 residents), and continued major projects such as the Limpopo Central Academic Hospital (R5 billion), Siloam District Hospital (R1.8 billion), and the Parliament Rebuilding Project (R3.6 billion), all of which were within budget and progressing to completion between 2026 and 2028. 4.158. Operational efficiency remained high, with digitalisation and automation of four business processes against a target of three, and successful implementation of a new organisational culture strategy. Stakeholder satisfaction, however, was slightly below target (score: 3.74 out of 4), largely due to calls for faster processing times and broader awareness of DBSA’s service offerings. 4.159. The Bank identified three partially achieved targets during the year: the value of infrastructure delivered (R5.2 billion against R5.6 billion target), the number of transactions committed to black- owned entities (7 out of a target of 8), and stakeholder satisfaction (3.74 against a target of 4). The delays were attributed to payment lags from clients, budget cuts during implementation, and slower conversion of pipeline projects. 4.160. Looking forward, the DBSA aims to expand its impact through targeted investments in energy, water, transport, and digital infrastructure, scale up its Public-Private Partnership (PPP) programmes, and strengthen its role in the Rail Private Sector Participation (PSP) initiative with Transnet and PRASA. 22",

Its mandate is to promote equitable ownership of agricultural land, support agrarian transformation, and contribute to food security by financing and facilitating the participation of historically disadvantaged persons in the agricultural economy. 4.162. During the 2024/25 financial year, the Bank remained in the stabilisation phase (FY23–FY25) of its three-phase turnaround strategy, focused on restoring financial stability, remediating non-performing loans (NPLs), concluding its liability solution, and implementing a sustainable operating model. The liability restructuring process was concluded in September 2024, marking the end of a four-year default period. The Bank’s focus shifted to compliance with restructuring covenants, rebuilding its loan book, and embedding governance reforms 4.163. The gross loan book declined by 12 percent year-on-year, primarily due to conservative lending and ongoing NPL remediation efforts. However, the NPL portfolio decreased from R12.4 billion in 2022 to R8.4 billion in 2025, reflecting steady progress under the remediation strategy. The Bank aims to further reduce NPLs to R6.6 billion by 2028, supported by stronger collections, write-offs, and portfolio reviews. The net interest margin improved to 6.7 percent, while the cost-to-income ratio stood at 43 percent, and the credit loss ratio at 3.6 percent. 4.164. Despite an unsuccessful Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) capital request for FY2025, the Bank continued to engage National Treasury on potential state guarantees and alternative funding models to mitigate projected liquidity risks in FY2027. The Bank achieved 83 percent of its shareholder compact indicators, with 19 achieved and 4 unachieved, while maintaining PFMA compliance and unqualified audit outcomes for all group entities. 4.165. Development effectiveness improved substantially, largely driven by the Blended Finance Scheme (BFS), a public–private partnership aimed at increasing inclusion of historically disadvantaged farmers in commercial agriculture. Since its inception in FY2023, the scheme has approved R3.443 billion in transactions (R1.74 billion loans and R1.703 billion grants). By March 2025, R2.571 billion had been disbursed, R1.281 billion in loans and R1.29 billion in grants, across 423 clients, enabling 784,000 hectares of farmland to enter production. A pipeline of R3.157 billion (R1.766 billion loans and R1.391 billion grants) was in progress, with additional grant funding required to sustain growth. 4.166. The Bank supported several high-impact agricultural enterprises, including Mazeli Farming (Limpopo), a 100 percent black woman-owned business expanding its crop production with Land Bank financing; Mr. Frans Mokoena (Free State), who expanded his farm from 807 to 2,838 hectares through BFS support; and Elmboog Organic Farming (Northern Cape), which transitioned from a failed restitution project to a top-tier raisin producer employing over 300 workers. These success stories reflect the Bank’s progress in translating its developmental mandate into measurable socio-economic outcomes. 4.167. On institutional capacity, 97.5 percent of staff were placed under the new structure, with a vacancy rate of 3.4 percent. The Bank implemented a Performance Management Policy (March 2025) and a Culture Change Framework (approved March 2025). It re-engineered three core business processes, loan origination, collateral management, and facility restructuring, all approved by Executive Committee in March 2025. These reforms contributed to improvements in turnaround times and strengthened client-centricity. 4.168. Financial sustainability indicators showed improvement.

Two Material Irregularities (MIs) were confirmed by the AGSA in 2024/25, involving Daybreak Farm (Pty) Ltd and Enable Capital Receivables Finance (ECRF) (Pty) Ltd. In the Daybreak case, the PIC invested R1.7 billion, plus R150 million post-commencement finance (PCF) to prevent liquidation, while a R250 million additional investment was made in February 2025. The entity entered business rescue in June 2025, with a creditor-approved turnaround plan by September 2025. The ECRF matter involved a R200 million facility, with R100 million disbursed in 2024; subsequent default led to business rescue and a High Court judgment in favour of the PIC for R108.9 million plus interest. 4.187. The unlisted investment portfolio stood at R71 billion, comprising 153 active investments across clients (GEPF 79 percent, UIF 19 percent, and CF 3 percent). Capital repayments of R43 billion had been received, derisking 43 percent of the portfolio, and the 2022 GEPF unlisted allocation achieved a 16 percent internal rate of return (IRR) as at 31 March 2025. Top performing investments included Old Mutual Private Equity (35 percent IRR), Siyanda Resources (29 percent), Jasper Solar (27 percent), and Africa Capital Works (21 percent). 4.188. The unlisted property portfolio was valued at R58.9 billion, representing 397 assets with a combined gross lettable area of 4.8 million m² and year-on-year asset growth of 15.6 percent. The portfolio composition included retail (53 percent), office (22 percent), specialised (17 percent), industrial (5 percent), and student accommodation (2 percent) properties. 4.189. In terms of social impact, the PIC’s investments facilitated 200,556 jobs, up from 190,258 in the previous year, with 49,456 occupied by women and 85,757 by men. Sectoral contributions included 31,433 jobs in agriculture, 21,295 in financial services, 12,819 in mining, 9,088 in construction, 8,000 in healthcare, and 7,907 in property and retail. Housing investments financed 72,099 housing units, including 6,521 social and affordable units through partnerships with GPF and Royal Bafokeng Properties. 4.190. On transformation, 87 percent of total funds were allocated to black economic empowerment (BEE) firms, and R3.7 billion was allocated to transformed fund managers since 2022. Of seven multi- managed funds, five achieved Level 2 B-BBEE status or better. The PIC employed 443 staff members, 55 percent of whom were women. Africans constituted 86.23 percent of total staff, while women represented 41 percent of senior and top management. A total of R5.7 million was disbursed for bursaries, funding 51 students nationally, 76 percent of whom were women. 4.191. The Corporation declared a dividend of R145 million to the shareholder (National Treasury), up from R141 million in 2023/24, and maintained financial assets (cash reserves) of R3.6 billion. The net profit margin rose to 31 percent, supported by stable operating income and cost containment measures.

    "recommendation": "5. OVERVIEW OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONS FINANCIAL AND FISCAL COMMISSION PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW (2024/25) 5.1. The Financial and Fiscal Commission is a constitutional advisory institution established in terms of Section 220 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, and governed by the Financial and Fiscal Commission Act, 1997 (Act No. 99 of 1997). The FFC’s mandate is to make recommendations to Parliament, provincial legislatures, and organs of state on financial and fiscal matters, including the equitable division of nationally raised revenue among the three spheres of government and the design of intergovernmental fiscal relations frameworks. 5.2. During the 2024/25 financial year, the FFC sustained an unqualified audit opinion for the third consecutive year, with material findings on compliance relating to procurement processes and expenditure management. These findings stemmed from delayed supplier payments, weak record- keeping, and late submission of annual financial statements (AFS) and performance reports to the Audit Committee. Despite these control weaknesses, the AGSA confirmed that all material misstatements in the AFS and annual performance report (APR) were corrected during the audit process, and no material findings were raised on the usefulness or reliability of reported performance information. 5.3. The FFC achieved 85.7 percent of its performance indicators (14 of 16 targets). Programme 1 (Administration) met 77.8 percent (7 of 9 indicators), while Programme 2 (Research) achieved 100 percent (7 of 7 indicators). The FFC met all key research deliverables, including its Annual Submission on the Division of Revenue, Technical Research Report, policy briefs, and submissions on the Appropriation Bill and the MTBPS. These outputs collectively informed Parliament’s deliberations on fiscal policy, public finance reforms, and intergovernmental transfers. 5.4. The financial statements reflected a deficit of R584,171, compared to R1.59 million in 2023/24, a",

However, liquidity improved significantly, with cash and cash equivalents rising by 68.8 percent from R16.47 million to R27.79 million, and net cash flow from operations moving from a negative R10.24 million in 2023/24 to a positive R11.38 million in 2024/25. The creditor payment period improved from 54 to 43 days, although compliance with the 30-day requirement remained a challenge. 5.5. Key governance changes were implemented to stabilise operations. The Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Duncan Thulani Ntuli) and Chief Financial Officer (Ms. Ansuyah Maharaj-Dowra) were appointed during the year, filling positions that had been vacant in the prior cycle. These appointments are expected to strengthen the internal control environment and financial governance. The Audit Committee’s oversight was constrained by the delayed submission of the AFS and APR, limiting timely review before audit submission, but corrective measures have since been introduced. 5.6. The FFC identified vacancies and skills shortages in the finance and supply chain management units as the main cause of recurring audit findings. Recruitment for finance and SCM support staff is underway, and interim oversight has been assigned to manage procurement and contract variation controls. A credible audit improvement plan has been adopted, incorporating monthly reconciliations, GRAP compliance checklists, and SOP implementation to address recurring deficiencies. These actions are monitored quarterly by the Audit and Risk Committee, supported by the Internal Audit function. 27",

Continuous engagement with National Treasury and the Standing Committee on Finance will remain central to ensuring evidence-based fiscal policy advice. SOUTH AFRICAN RESERVE BANK GROUP OVERVIEW (2024/25) 5.12. The South African Reserve Bank is the central bank of the Republic of South Africa, established under the Currency and Banking Act of 1921 and currently governed by the South African Reserve Bank Act, 1989 (Act No. 90 of 1989). Its constitutional mandate, in terms of Section 224 of the Constitution, is to protect the value of the currency in the interest of balanced and sustainable economic growth. The SARB carries out this function through monetary policy, financial stability oversight, prudential supervision, payment-system management, and the holding of official gold and foreign-exchange reserves. It also acts as banker to government and provides settlement facilities to the financial system. 5.13. The SARB functions as a group consisting of the central bank and four main subsidiaries: the South African Bank Note Company, the South African Mint (including the Prestige Bullion joint venture with Rand Refinery), the Corporation for Public Deposits, and the Corporation for Deposit Insurance. The Bank also holds a 50 percent strategic shareholding in African Bank Holdings Limited (ABHL), accounted for using the equity method. The SARB Group forms the core of South Africa’s financial- stability safety net together with the Prudential Authority (PA), Financial Sector Conduct Authority, and Financial Intelligence Centre. 5.14. For the 2024/25 financial year, the SARB Group achieved 95 percent of its performance indicators and received an unqualified audit opinion with no material findings from its independent external auditors, BDO and SNG Grant Thornton. The group financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Total assets increased by 6.8 percent to R1.61 trillion, while total liabilities rose by 5.9 percent to R1.52 trillion, resulting in group equity of R86.2 billion at 31 March 2025. The increase in assets was mainly due to higher foreign-reserve holdings and valuation gains under the Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account (GFECRA). 5.15. Group income rose to R40.7 billion from R37.4 billion in 2023/24, largely reflecting higher interest income on reserves and domestic investments. Operating expenditure increased by 5.4 percent to R18.6 billion, mainly because of inflationary adjustments and information-technology modernisation. The group posted a net profit of R4.3 billion, up from R3.7 billion the previous year. In accordance with the SARB Act, dividends of R200,000 were paid to private shareholders, with R3.9 billion transferred to the National Revenue Fund.

It commends the FIC’s leadership in coordinating risk-based supervision across financial and non-financial sectors but emphasises that the post-greylisting phase must prioritise sustained enforcement and measurable support by FIC data to convictions, asset recoveries and deterrence. 6.34. The Committee notes that total expenditure for 2024/25 comprised approximately R247.7 million in personnel costs, R170.5 million in operating expenses and R23.9 million in capital expenditure. These figures reflect prudent financial management and efficient utilisation of available resources. 6.35. The Committee acknowledges the FIC’s contribution to multi-agency cooperation through platforms such as the Fusion Centre, the Asset-Recovery Hub and the Shared Forensic Capability. These initiatives have enhanced coordination between the FIC, the National Prosecuting Authority, the South African Police Service and the South African Revenue Service. The Committee encourages continued collaboration to ensure that intelligence referrals translate into tangible enforcement outcomes. 6.36. The Committee notes that 556 inspections were conducted across accountable institutions during the year, resulting in administrative sanctions of approximately R2.2 million imposed by the FIC, in addition to penalties levied by other supervisory authorities. The Committee urges intensified supervisory attention and training for higher-risk non-financial sectors to strengthen compliance with customer-due-diligence and reporting obligations. 6.37.

The Committee recommends that National Treasury, SALGA, and the FSCA jointly submit a remedial action plan within three months, identifying high-risk municipalities, repayment timelines, and disciplinary measures for persistent non-compliance. 6.50. The Committee notes that unclaimed financial assets amount to approximately R30.1 billion across about three million members, with the majority of cases concentrated in 60 retirement funds. The Committee welcomes the FSCA’s initiative to establish a central database of unclaimed assets and standardise tracing processes. However, progress remains at an early stage, and data quality continues to limit verification and beneficiary tracing. 6.51. The Committee recommends that the FSCA and National Treasury finalise the regulatory framework for unclaimed financial assets by March 2026, including the assignment of clear roles and accountability for tracing, disbursement, and disclosure, and ensure that the centralised database becomes operational by mid-2026. 6.52. The Committee notes that the FSCA continues to expand its supervision of fintech and crypto-asset markets, having licensed 10 crypto-asset service providers in 2024/25 and launched a regulatory sandbox to encourage innovation under controlled conditions. The Committee welcomes these developments but stresses that rapid digitalisation requires stronger cybersecurity protocols and consumer safeguards to prevent systemic and retail risks. 6.53. The Committee recommends that the FSCA table an annual fintech and digital-finance risk report to Parliament, detailing regulatory gaps, consumer-protection cases, and inter-agency coordination with the Prudential Authority and South African Reserve Bank on digital-asset supervision. 6.54. The Committee notes that the FSCA employs 681 staff members, of whom 51 percent are women and 91 percent are black, with women constituting 75 percent of the executive team. The Committee commends the Authority for achieving employment equity targets but notes that turnover in technical units remains high due to competitive private-sector demand. 6.55. The Committee recommends that the FSCA prioritise retention and succession planning strategies for scarce technical skills, expand graduate and bursary programmes, and report annually on progress in staff retention, leadership diversity, and institutional capacity-building. PRUDENTIAL AUTHORITY 6.56. The Committee notes that the Prudential Authority continues to provide stability to the banking and insurance supervisory environment under the Twin Peaks model. The prudential framework remains aligned with international standards, with continued supervisory emphasis on capital adequacy, liquidity resilience, asset quality, governance and risk management across banks, insurers and systemically important non-bank financial institutions. 6.57. The Committee observes that South Africa’s post-resolution architecture, anchored in the Financial Sector Laws Amendment Act and the operationalisation of deposit insurance, has materially strengthened the safety-net for retail depositors and enhanced orderly-resolution readiness for systemic firms. The Authority’s ongoing work on recovery and resolution planning for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and selected insurers is welcomed, but fuller visibility on testing outcomes and inter-agency coordination (including with the Resolution Authority, SARB Financial Stability function and National Treasury) would assist parliamentary oversight. 6.58. The Committee notes that bank capital and liquidity positions remain sound at the system level, with prudential ratios above minimum requirements, notwithstanding headwinds from weak growth, load- shedding legacies, logistics constraints and higher-for-longer interest rates. Credit risk remains elevated in specific portfolios (household unsecured credit, small business lending and certain commercial real-estate segments). The Authority’s use of targeted stress testing and thematic reviews is appropriate; however, more granular supervisory feedback to the market on concentration 35",

The Committee further notes the significant growth in the candidate auditor pipeline, which increased from 123 to 205 in 2024/25, aided by reduced registration fees and enhanced outreach. This pipeline is increasingly diverse, with 52 % of candidates from African, Coloured, or Indian backgrounds and 53 % being female. The Committee welcomes this progress and encourages the IRBA to deepen collaboration with professional bodies like SAICA and ACCA to further expand opportunities for Black and female auditors. 6.101. The Committee expresses concern regarding threats to auditor safety from corruption and criminal syndicates, particularly within the public sector. While acknowledging that the IRBA’s mandate does not include security provision, the Committee recommends that it continue to collaborate with law enforcement and professional bodies to ensure auditors can perform their duties free from intimidation or undue pressure. 6.102. The Committee takes note of the IRBA’s sound financial position, with total revenue of R209.8 million, approximately 72 % of which was derived from fees and levies. The IRBA clarified that accumulated surpluses are retained, with National Treasury’s approval, to fund potentially high-cost disciplinary proceedings. The Committee notes this prudent fiscal approach but recommends that the IRBA provide annual disclosure on the proportion of reserves ring-fenced for enforcement to enhance transparency. 6.103. The Committee further notes improvements in enforcement performance, with the IRBA exceeding its target by finalising over 80 investigations and achieving a 90 % disciplinary completion rate. These results are welcomed as evidence of a more responsive regulatory environment, bolstered by legislative amendments that allow for non-audit matters to be referred to professional bodies for resolution. 6.104. The Committee recommends that the IRBA continue its annual publication of reportable irregularity and enforcement statistics disaggregated by sector and violation type; deepen collaboration with the FSCA, FIC, and SARS to strengthen its referral network and improve the timeliness of cross- regulatory action; and brief Parliament annually on trends in audit quality, enforcement outcomes, and transformation within the profession. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD 6.105. The Committee acknowledges the statutory mandate of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) to develop, issue and promote high-quality accounting standards for all spheres of government, as provided for in section 89 of the Public Finance Management Act (1999). The Committee welcomes the ASB’s clean audit opinion for the 2024/25 financial year, achieved since the entity’s inception, which reflects continued sound governance, fiscal discipline and adherence to effective internal- control systems. 6.106. The Committee notes that the ASB achieved 10 of 14 planned outputs (approximately 71 percent) for the year, compared with 64 percent in 2023/24. Key achievements included maintaining and updating the Standards of Generally Recognised Accounting Practice (GRAP), strengthening implementation guidance, and advancing work toward the long-term transition of the public sector to accrual-based financial reporting. The Committee commends this improvement in performance and consistency in technical delivery despite limited resources. 6.107. The Committee welcomes the ASB’s continued technical alignment with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB). During 2024/25 the ASB completed projects on revenue, leases and financial instruments, and contributed to international deliberations through responses to IPSASB exposure drafts. Implementation guidance for GRAP 109 (Accounting by Principals and Agents) and GRAP 25 (Employee Benefits) was also advanced, contributing to improved quality and comparability of public-sector financial statements. 6.108.

This inclusive approach ensures that South Africa’s GRAP framework remains robust, credible and responsive to the evolving needs of the public sector. 6.111. The Committee notes the ASB’s progress in developing a Post-Implementation Review Framework, which will provide an evidence-based mechanism for evaluating the cost-effectiveness, impact and implementation challenges of GRAP standards. The Committee supports the timely operationalisation of this framework as part of continuous improvement in public-sector accounting. 6.112. The Committee acknowledges that the ASB continues to deliver technically rigorous outputs through a lean organisational structure of highly skilled personnel. To safeguard institutional capability, the Committee underscores the importance of succession planning, retention of technical expertise and the creation of specialist career-development pathways. 6.113. The Committee recommends that the ASB deepen its collaboration with the Auditor-General of South Africa, provincial treasuries and municipal CFO forums to promote consistent application of GRAP standards and strengthen institutional readiness for accrual accounting. The ASB should report annually to Parliament on the progress of accrual reforms, capacity-building outcomes and challenges faced by preparers. 6.114. The Committee further recommends that National Treasury review the ASB’s funding model to secure its long-term sustainability and that the ASB finalise and implement its Post-Implementation Review Framework to evaluate systematically the effectiveness of GRAP standards in enhancing accountability, transparency and comparability across the public sector. GOVERNMENT TECHNICAL ADVISORY CENTRE 6.115. The Committee notes that the Government Technical Advisory Centre (GTAC) continues to serve as a critical technical arm of the National Treasury, established in terms of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and the 2015 GTAC Regulations, to provide advisory, analytical, and programme management support to organs of state. GTAC’s work aligns with national strategic priorities, including infrastructure development, public expenditure efficiency, and job creation. 6.116. The Committee observes that GTAC achieved an unqualified audit opinion for the 2024/25 financial year, maintaining its record of sound financial governance. The entity achieved 93 percent of its performance indicators and continued to demonstrate operational efficiency across its advisory and programme management functions. Revenue amounted to R204 million, with expenditure of R198 million, resulting in a surplus of R6 million. GTAC’s income sources were composed of cost-recovery fees (46 percent), voted funds (28 percent), and interest income (22 percent). 6.117. The Committee notes that GTAC completed 22 spending reviews during 2024/25, covering R142.2 billion in public expenditure, including four reviews focused on the compensation of employees. The Centre also undertook 16 consulting and technical support projects valued at R56 million, and through the Jobs Fund, managed 101 projects valued at R65 million, cumulatively creating 337 534 jobs at an average cost of R23 500 per job. The Committee welcomes this contribution to job creation and notes that the Jobs Fund continues to leverage public and private funding. 6.118. The Committee further notes that GTAC’s Infrastructure and Project Preparation Facility supported the assessment of 15 Budget Facility for Infrastructure (BFI) projects valued at approximately R149 billion, and 27 priority infrastructure projects valued at R35 billion per annum. The Centre’s Infrastructure Hub facilitated tenders exceeding R2 billion annually, contributing to the improved quality and feasibility of project appraisals across the state. 6.119. The Committee notes that GTAC maintained high levels of client satisfaction, with 91 percent of government clients rating GTAC’s services as “satisfied” or “very satisfied.” Repeat engagements accounted for 38 percent of projects. The Committee notes that GTAC’s workforce remains highly qualified, with 44 percent of staff holding postgraduate qualifications and 56 percent being female. 6.120.

DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SOUTHERN AFRICA 6.126. The Committee acknowledges the Development Bank of Southern Africa’s (DBSA) critical role as a state-owned development finance institution established under the DBSA Act (No. 13 of 1997) and operating as part of the national infrastructure ecosystem under the shareholder oversight of the National Treasury. The Bank’s mandate to promote inclusive infrastructure-led growth, build municipal capacity, and support regional integration remains central to the government’s development objectives. 6.127. The Committee notes the DBSA’s clean audit outcome for the 2024/25 financial year, maintaining a record of unqualified audits since its inception. The Bank continues to demonstrate stability at the board and executive levels, supported by an embedded culture of accountability and a comprehensive compliance framework. 6.128. The Committee notes that the DBSA met most of its headline key performance indicators for 2024/25, including a return on equity of 9.3 percent, a cost-to-income ratio of 19.3 percent for the financing business (well below the 35-percent benchmark), and total disbursements of R17.5 billion against a target of R14.5 billion. Total revenue amounted to R13.45 billion, while net profit increased to R5.32 billion. The Bank’s total assets stood at R121 billion, supported by a liquidity position of R15 billion and a capital-leverage ratio of 78 percent, significantly below the prudential ceiling of 250 percent. Although the value of infrastructure delivered reached R5.2 billion, this fell short of the R5.6 billion target by approximately R400 million. 6.129. The Committee welcomes the Bank’s continued financial soundness, underscored by positive ratings from Moody’s and S&P and the retention of Green Climate Fund (GCF) accreditation. It notes that approximately 70 percent of the loan book (R79 billion) is invested in South Africa, while",

The Committee recommends that the Bank intensify oversight of project-execution timelines and ensure that budgeted resources yield timely and measurable outputs. 6.136. The Committee further notes public and Member concerns regarding delays and governance issues in the reconstruction of Parliament and other projects under the Bank’s implementation. The DBSA informed the Committee that the revised project milestone for Parliament targets practical completion by November 2026 and full commissioning by early 2027. The Committee stresses the importance of strict oversight, transparent reporting, and independent quality assurance to ensure accountability, value for money, and protection of workers’ rights on all outsourced projects. 6.137. The Committee acknowledges that the DBSA continues to implement robust risk-management practices, with its Audit and Risk Committee functioning independently and regularly assessing strategic and operational risks. Liquidity and credit risks remain well controlled, but the Committee emphasises that the Bank must maintain vigilant oversight of its municipal lending portfolio and implement enhanced credit-risk analytics to detect potential defaults early. 6.138. The Committee welcomes the DBSA’s transformation achievements, with 53 percent female representation and 88 percent black representation among its 1 001 employees. It also notes the development of youth-focused programmes in the construction sector aimed at empowering young entrepreneurs and creating employment pathways for graduates lacking experience. 6.139. The Committee notes the clarification provided by the DBSA regarding its previous memorandum of understanding with the sanctioned Russian bank VEB.RF. The Bank confirmed that no credit facilities, financial transactions, or investments exist under this MOU. The Committee calls for continued vigilance to ensure full compliance with international sanctions and anti-money-laundering frameworks. 6.140. The Committee recommends that the DBSA: (a) Accelerate the conversion of prepared projects into implementation through enhanced feasibility planning and intergovernmental coordination, including increasing its institutional capacity (b) Report quarterly to Parliament on the Infrastructure Fund’s financial commitments, disbursements, and catalytic impacts. (c) Implement a comprehensive review of project-management practices to address delays and cost overruns, including the Parliament rebuild. 43",

The Committee further notes the progress made in portfolio rehabilitation and collections but emphasises the need for more proactive credit-risk management, particularly in high-risk agricultural subsectors exposed to climate volatility and market shocks. 6.148. The Committee observes that the loan book contracted by 12 percent year-on-year to R28.4 billion, driven mainly by the cautious lending approach necessitated by liquidity constraints and legacy risk exposures. While this conservative strategy has stabilised the Bank, it also limits its developmental reach. The Committee encourages the Bank to accelerate the responsible expansion of its loan 44",

However, the Committee remains concerned about uneven geographic coverage and calls for targeted interventions in under-served provinces such as the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, and Limpopo. 6.153. The Committee recommends that the Land Bank: (a) Achieve a clean audit outcome by 2025/26, through the full implementation of audit-action plans and the automation of performance reporting. (b) Finalise and table its long-term funding model to ensure sustainable operations beyond the current recapitalisation support. (c) Strengthen credit-risk analytics and climate-risk assessment tools to mitigate portfolio vulnerabilities. (d) Accelerate blended-finance disbursements and ensure equitable provincial distribution of developmental lending with spatial equity, particularly in rural areas. (e) Consolidate governance gains by filling all critical leadership vacancies and embedding succession planning; and (f) Report quarterly to Parliament on loan-book growth, NPL reduction, and the performance of its insurance subsidiaries and continue to prioritise products for small holdings and emerging farmers. PUBLIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION 6.154. The Committee acknowledges the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) as South Africa’s largest asset manager and a critical anchor of the domestic financial system. As at 31 March 2025, the PIC manages R3.05 trillion in assets under management (AUM) on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund, the Unemployment Insurance Fund, the Compensation Funds, and several other clients. This represents a 13.3 percent increase from R2.69 trillion in 2023/24, primarily driven by strong equity-market performance, reinvested investment income, and steady inflows from its public-sector clients. 6.155. The Committee notes that the GEPF remains the PIC’s dominant client, accounting for R2.68 trillion or 87.8 percent of total AUM, followed by the UIF at 5.6 percent (R170 billion), the Compensation Funds and Compensation Commissioner combined at 4.4 percent (R133 billion), and smaller clients contributing 2.2 percent (R66 billion). This composition underscores the PIC’s systemic significance within the public-sector pension environment and the need for prudent liquidity management and diversification of mandates to mitigate concentration risk. 6.156. The Committee notes that the PIC obtained an unqualified audit opinion with material findings for the 2024/25 financial year, the same outcome as the prior year.

    "recommendation": "that all investment activities are aligned with approved governance standards. 6.157. The Committee notes that the PIC achieved 95 percent of its annual performance targets, compared to 90 percent in 2023/24. Total income increased by 8 percent to R1.66 billion, driven by a 4 percent increase in management fees and a 27 percent rise in other income, mainly from investee companies. Net profit rose by 89 percent to R512 million, reflecting improved investment performance and operational efficiency. The cost-to-income ratio stood at 41 percent, with personnel and ICT modernisation costs accounting for the bulk of expenditure. 6.158. The Committee notes the two material irregularities raised by the Auditor-General concerning Daybreak Foods (Pty) Ltd and Enable Capital Receivables Finance (Pty) Ltd, both linked to governance lapses in unlisted investments. The PIC is required to submit the four forensic reports on Daybreak Foods to Parliament, together with the corresponding law-enforcement referral details and case numbers, by 02 December 2025. 6.159. The Committee welcomes the PIC’s progress in implementing the Mpati Commission of Inquiry recommendations, particularly regarding governance, transparency, and risk management. The revised Investment Policy Framework, updated Client Mandate Charters, and Lifestyle Audit Policy for executives have been finalised. The Committee requires a comprehensive written report mapping each Mpati recommendation to its implementation status, law-enforcement referrals, and reasons where no referral was made, to be submitted by 02 December 2025. 6.160. The Committee notes that the active unlisted investment portfolio totals approximately R71 billion, comprising 153 active investments across the GEPF (79 percent), UIF (19 percent), and Compensation Funds (3 percent). The total committed capital stands at R111 billion, of which R99 billion has been invested and R43 billion repaid. The unlisted portfolio achieved an internal rate of return of 16 percent on the 2022 GEPF unlisted allocation. The Committee therefore requires the PIC to submit a full schedule of current valuations and methodologies applied for 2024/25, including details of independent validations, by 02 December 2025. 6.161. The Committee further requires a comprehensive schedule of all unlisted property investments, including the date of purchase, vendor or entity from whom each asset was acquired, purchase price, current valuation, and impairment history, together with a technical memorandum outlining the year-end valuation methodology applied for 2024/25, to be submitted by 02 December 2025. 6.162. The Committee notes with concern the levels of impairments and distressed assets within the unlisted portfolio. The PIC must submit a detailed breakdown of total impairments, percentage share relative to total unlisted assets, underlying reasons for impairments, and mitigation measures instituted to reduce exposure to future losses, by 02 December 2025. 6.163. The Committee requires that the PIC disclose the total value of investments that experienced non- compliance with internal investment policies and relevant legislation during 2024/25, including a sectoral distribution of affected transactions and remedial actions undertaken, by 02 December 2025. 6.164. The Committee requests that the PIC provide empirical evidence explaining the reported low demand for SMME finance, including application volumes, approval rates, decline rates, ticket sizes, turnaround times, and identified barriers to access. This report should also outline the corrective measures being developed to increase inclusivity and credit access for small and medium enterprises, by 02 December 2025. 6.165. The Committee welcomes the PIC’s continued commitment to transformation in the financial sector. During 2024/25, R146 billion in assets were allocated to black-owned asset managers, up from R133 billion the previous year. Eighty-seven percent of asset managers now meet at least a Level 2 B-BBEE rating. The Committee urges the PIC to deepen partnerships with black and women-owned asset managers through mentorship and incubation programmes to promote sectoral equity and transformation. 6.166. The Committee commends the PIC’s strong financial performance, recording R3.05 trillion in AUM, R1.66 billion in revenue, and a net profit of R512 million. However, credibility will ultimately depend on transparent disclosure, timely consequence management, and the demonstration of corrective action. 6.167. The Committee will conduct an oversight visit to the PIC focused on unlisted investment governance, valuation practices, and implementation of the Mpati Commission recommendations during the 2025/26 financial year. 46",

The Committee notes that SARB continues to maintain a resilient financial system despite external shocks, including global tariff pressures and domestic infrastructure constraints. The Bank’s vulnerability matrix identified household debt, infrastructure failures, and money-laundering risks as key concerns. The Governor reported progress in addressing the risks associated with the FATF grey-listing, noting that the risk level has now been reduced. 6.201.

The Committee affirms that this 2024/25 Budgetary Review and Recommendations Report (BRRR) constitutes a comprehensive evaluation of the performance, governance, and financial sustainability of the National Treasury and the entities and institutions within the Finance Portfolio. These include constitutional institutions, regulatory bodies, state-owned financial entities, and development finance institutions that collectively underpin South Africa’s fiscal stability, financial integrity, and economic transformation agenda. 7.2. The Committee recognises that while the National Treasury provides the overarching framework for fiscal policy, public finance management, and economic governance, several institutions within the portfolio, such as the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), and the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA), exercise constitutionally or statutorily independent mandates. This institutional diversity reflects the constitutional design of South Africa’s financial governance architecture, which balances accountability, operational autonomy, and developmental imperatives. 7.3. The Committee will process and adopt its report on the oversight visit to the South African Reserve Bank Group and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority in early December, before the end of the current parliamentary term. 7.4.

Explanations - Underspending and Variances Real Estate Management Services  The low spending was due to municipal services that the PMTE paid on behalf of the client departments. Although the function of payments for municipal services was devolved in 2006, the PMTE continued administering these accounts on behalf of the clients. The PMTE reported that this would be devolved in totality and had to be phased out but could not state a date when this would be completed.  The PMTE reported that this cost item was fully recoverable and that it was included for cash flow purposes.  Municipal Services expenditure was based on actual consumption by client departments and usually fluctuated due to factors such as electricity usage and load shedding as well as alternative energy solutions implemented by some client departments.  As with the previous cost item, the PMTE stated that this budget amount was reported as for cash flow projection purposes and was not to be treated as an underspending.  The unspent funds which were allocated for the rectification of illegally occupied properties",

Construction Project Management Services  In the fourth quarter performance report, the PMTE reported that it completed 59 out of the targeted 125 construction projects - this meant that by the end of the financial year it achieved only 47% of its predetermined target.  In engagements with this committee on its fourth quarter performance, the PMTE provided reasons such as construction projects across the country being stopped by local contractors demanding participation in projects; slow progress due to financial/cash flow difficulties of small and medium sized contractors; approval of funding by the client departments after awarding of projects; in some cases contractors requesting extension of project completion time due to late finalisation of internet infrastructure installation and access routes required for certain courts and legal offices by the Department of Justice and Correctional Services client; in other cases, extension of project completion time due to having to source another contractor; inclement weather; and in other cases, the inability of the client department availing the working space for the contractor etc.  In the meeting discussing its annual report, the delays reported in the quarterly performance report showed that the entity was unable to prevent these from negatively impacting on the PMTE‟s expenditure trends.  The PMTE explained that although the difference between the allocated budget and actual expenditure by the end of the financial year might look like an overspending, it was offset by underspending on the capital items; this was due to a reclassification of projects between capital and operational payments.  Delays in budget approvals led to under-expenditure as projects could not be placed on the PMTE procurement plan without client departments signing off on the allocated budgets and cost of projects. In cases where recommended bids were higher than the estimated costs and increased the cost of the projects, the PMTE had to request approval from the client departments before tenders were advertised. Delays in client responses was the major cause of under-expenditure. Clients were expected to sign-off on their available allocations before the start of the financial year, but some client department make allocations for construction projects available only during the first quarter of the financial year.  On-site defaulting contractors and other subcontractors that do not deliver in accordance to the projected project expenditure caused further delays.  Delays in the filling vacant funded positions also contributed to under-spending.",

Systems uptime – a crucial aspect for a company that relies on its online capabilities to allow contractors and clients to fulfil their responsibilities – reached 98% against a target of 95%.  The target for implementation of the action plan emanating from NSF discussions was also surpassed. This far-reaching list, agreed with the former Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, required action in key areas such as revisions to the RoC and procurement.  With the consistently high level of underspending on infrastructure budgets hampering activity in the sector, client capacitation continued to be prioritised during 2022/2023. The entity exceeded the planned number of client departments to be assisted by more than 30, bringing the total to 110.  Seventy-one clients were capacitated on contractor development programmes, double the targeted 36, while 377 grades one to six contractors were provided with development support.  Stakeholder management saw the entity travelling throughout the nine provinces to ensure awareness of its services to construction contractors. The provincial stakeholder liaison meeting initiative gained momentum and the CIDB to reach scores of public sector clients and grades 5 to 9 contractors. In this way, the sector was made aware of criteria for the RoC and the processes to be registered.  The entity engaged with clients to promote the Infrastructure Delivery Management System (IDMS) and discussed to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the flow of funds to projects. The B.U.I.L.D Programme received a prominent platform during these encounters, as the entity encouraged clients to comply in the interests of elevating the industry through skills, knowledge, and empowerment.  Our NSF for 2021 to 2023 remained focused on the issues most important to the industry, convening six meetings of its task teams, which were formed to delve more deeply into priority projects.  The entity‟s Empowerment and Recognition of Women in Construction (ERWIC) awards staged its third celebration of excellence in August 2022.

This equals an under expenditure of R272.0 million (or 3.3 percent) of the total appropriation. The department reported that the under expenditure occurred under all five main programmes. At the same time Programmes 1 to 5, reported that the underspending was mainly due to: Compensation of Employees (delays in filling of vacant posts, and non-implementation of projected annual salary adjustments); Goods and Services; Transfers and Subsidies; and Machinery and Equipment, to be discussed below. Spending was recorded as R7,531 billion which is 97.5 per cent of the adjusted budget of R7,724 billion. Programme 1: Administration received a final appropriation of R504.6 million and spent R416.5 million. This equates to under expenditure of R88.1 million or 17.5 per cent, by the end of the financial year as follows: • R32.0 million – Compensation of Employees, due to delays in filling vacant positions. • R52.0 million – Goods and Services mainly due to the nation-wide lockdown with the bulk of the activities being performed minimally, resulting in lower than projected expenditure. • R4.0 million – Machinery and Equipment due to delays in planned acquisition of assets resulting from unfilled vacant positions.

The investigation was finalised on 29 March 2019, confirmed the AGSA findings, and further identified additional irregularities with respect to each funeral. o The Department opened a case with the South African Police Service (SAPS) for civil recovery against the supplier as recommended by the Investigation Report. The case number is CAS 793/2020 opened at the Pretoria Central Police Station. The Investigation Report recommended disciplinary actions against the responsible officials. The matter was further referred to the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) on 18 September 2020. o An investigation by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) on the matter commenced in 2021, and indicated that the SIU will pursue a civil claim against the supplier. However, the SIU has not made the Report available to the Department. o The Communication noted that the Department approached the State Attorney to appoint legal counsel to assist the Department with disciplinary proceedings against the three officials still in the employ of the Department. The disciplinary proceedings are currently under way for the suspended Director-General and is being handled by The Presidency. The hearings for the other two officials implicated in the irregularity is being handled by the State Attorney. As at the date of this report, the disciplinary hearing had not been concluded against the officials. o A combined summons have been filed at the Gauteng High Court (Pretoria) for case number 20987/22, in a matter between Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure (Plaintiff) and the supplier on 01 April 2022. The summons is in relation to payments made by Department of Public Works and Infrastructure in excess of the agreed pricing schedule provided by the plaintiff during the tendering process stage by the supplier. This covers the two funerals in which the supplier was used to render services for the Mama Veronica Sobukwe funeral (R371 186) and the M Mtslali funeral (R124 315). The bulk amount of the outstanding financial loss to be recovered is being followed up by the SIU. The Accounting Officer wrote to Treasury (NT) on 27 January 2022 requesting the supplier and its director to be restricted from doing business with the State due to fraudulent misrepresentation when submitting invoices for payment in respect of State Funeral Services. The application was referred back by NT on 31 Mar 2022 on the basis of the restriction being on PPR of 2017. The department is currently implementing the recommendations made in the response by NT. o The Accounting Officer approved the Contract Management Policy on 11 April 2022, which sets out guidelines on contracts to enable effective delivery of goods, services and works in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. o The AG will follow up on the investigation and the implementation of the planned actions during the next audit.",

    "recommendation": "7.1 Background The PMTE was established in April 2006, as part of a long-term reform programme to provide improved property management services to client departments. National Treasury allocated a capitalisation amount of R450 million to initiate the process. From the start the challenge was to deal with the maintenance backlog of the immovable asset portfolio. This meant that all properties had to be recorded on a regularly updated national immovable asset register (IAR). It further meant that the immovable asset registers at municipal and provincial levels of government also had to be properly compiled and regularly updated. The main function of the PMTE is always referred to as the execution of all property management and maintenance related functions. The PMTE should do this on behalf of national government departments; this includes property rate and service related payments to municipalities. What is clear is that this more obvious iteration leaves the consistent task of coordinating the updating of municipal, provincial and national IARs in the shadows. This coordinating task requires a PMTE that has a footprint in every region and province of the country. That footprint is to be found in the eleven regional offices (ROs) that are headed by regional office managers reporting to the national DPWI. This is the network of offices within which the actual work of the PMTE, both the coordinating of the IARs and actual property management and maintenance related functions on behalf of government departments should take place. Even though it was established as early as 2006 as an internal entity of the department, it only started performing as an entity in 2014. Since then, its structure and functions have not been fully realised. To fully realise its function, the entity needs a full contingent of qualified, experienced property maintenance, information and communication technology (ICT), construction project, and contract management specialists. Such skilled personnel are hard to source and retain as they are absorbed by national and international property sector companies. The PMTE has therefore not been fully operational as a trading entity that can properly manage the government’s immovable asset register (IAR). It has since 2014 achieved some progress but struggles with consistent leadership that is required to overcome its human resource and financial management challenges. The full operationalisation is further facing the challenge of managing the property portfolio of government across eleven DPWI regional offices (ROs) headed by Regional Office Managers",

The allocation remained unchanged during the adjustment period.

The entity reported collecting an estimated R17.15 billion in revenue for the 2021/22 financial year. The final appropriation to the entity was R22.64 billion, which is an increase of R522.6 million from the R22.12 billion received in 2020/21. At the end of the 2021/22 financial year, the entity spent R19.75 billion (an under- expenditure of R2.89 billion or 12.8 per cent) for 2021/22.

The PMTE explained this under-expenditure as being due to the following: • Delays in the execution and finalisation of the projects. This was reported as being caused by poor performance by some of the contractors. There were also reported delays experienced due to deviation from the initially projected completion timeline of some construction projects. • Another reason posed in the report was the delay in finalizing some of the final accounts and the non or late submission of the final invoices by the contractors. • While the cost involved in such delays and deviations on construction projects are recoverable, the PMTE has to request approval from client departments before tenders are advertised, or when recommended bids are higher than the estimate and every time there is an increase in the cost of the project. • Delays in responses from client department are a major cause of underspending. Clients are expected to sign-off on their available allocations before the start of the financial year. Unfortunately, some clients only make the allocations available during the first quarter of the financial year. This leads to further delays and under- expenditure as projects cannot be placed on the procurement plan before approval of the budget. • The delay in the filling of the vacant funded positions have also contributed to under - spending.",

An amount of R9.68 million (R9 681 612) has already been recovered from the landlord as at year-end. • The PMTE entered into a contract with a service provider on 28 November 2013 to construct a Magistrate Court building at Mamelodi (WCS 044028). The contract was for a period of 18 months for construction and the contract value was R94.7 million (R94 742 592.85). o The construction of the Mamelodi Magistrate Court project has been significantly delayed and the expenditure paid to date exceed the initial contract amount. The practical completion date of the contract has been extended and the PMTE has been approving the contract extensions with adjustments to the contract value with the daily rate of R24 283,26 charged by the contractor. Based on the approved claims 4, 5, 8 and 9, the delays resulted from civil unrest, riots, strikes and lockouts. o This was a contravention of the JBCC 2000 Principal Building Agreement Clause 29.1, which stipulates that the contractor is entitled to a revision of the date of practical completion, but for which the contract value should not be adjusted if it pertains to delays related to civil unrest, riots or strikes.

These are reported as having resulted in actual expenditure exceeding budgeted expenditure. The difference was offset against the underspending as indicated above. Transformation The shortfall is attributable to the payment of TCC Chairpersons, which exceeded what was initially budgeted for. Skills and Capacity Development The surplus is attributable to accreditation visits not scheduled due to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in savings on travel. Research and Advisory The procurement of the Knowledge Management Hub was finalised towards the end of the financial year. The problem is that the Senior Manager and required staff positions remain vacant. This means that the Knowledge Hub may be finalised yet remains non-functional.

This equals an under expenditure of R272.0 million (or 3.3 percent) of the total appropriation. The department reported that the under expenditure occurred under all five main programmes. At the same time Programmes 1 to 5, reported that the underspending was mainly due to: Compensation of Employees (delays in filling of vacant posts, and non-implementation of projected annual salary adjustments); Goods and Services; Transfers and Subsidies; and Machinery and Equipment, to be discussed below. Spending was recorded as R7,531 billion which is 97.5 per cent of the adjusted budget of R7,724 billion. Programme 1: Administration received a final appropriation of R504.6 million and spent R416.5 million. This equates to under expenditure of R88.1 million or 17.5 per cent, by the end of the financial year as follows: • R32.0 million – Compensation of Employees, due to delays in filling vacant positions. • R52.0 million – Goods and Services mainly due to the nation-wide lockdown with the bulk of the activities being performed minimally, resulting in lower than projected expenditure. • R4.0 million – Machinery and Equipment due to delays in planned acquisition of assets resulting from unfilled vacant positions.

The investigation was finalised on 29 March 2019, confirmed the AGSA findings, and further identified additional irregularities with respect to each funeral. o The Department opened a case with the South African Police Service (SAPS) for civil recovery against the supplier as recommended by the Investigation Report. The case number is CAS 793/2020 opened at the Pretoria Central Police Station. The Investigation Report recommended disciplinary actions against the responsible officials. The matter was further referred to the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) on 18 September 2020. o An investigation by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) on the matter commenced in 2021, and indicated that the SIU will pursue a civil claim against the supplier. However, the SIU has not made the Report available to the Department. o The Communication noted that the Department approached the State Attorney to appoint legal counsel to assist the Department with disciplinary proceedings against the three officials still in the employ of the Department. The disciplinary proceedings are currently under way for the suspended Director-General and is being handled by The Presidency. The hearings for the other two officials implicated in the irregularity is being handled by the State Attorney. As at the date of this report, the disciplinary hearing had not been concluded against the officials. o A combined summons have been filed at the Gauteng High Court (Pretoria) for case number 20987/22, in a matter between Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure (Plaintiff) and the supplier on 01 April 2022. The summons is in relation to payments made by Department of Public Works and Infrastructure in excess of the agreed pricing schedule provided by the plaintiff during the tendering process stage by the supplier. This covers the two funerals in which the supplier was used to render services for the Mama Veronica Sobukwe funeral (R371 186) and the M Mtslali funeral (R124 315). The bulk amount of the outstanding financial loss to be recovered is being followed up by the SIU. The Accounting Officer wrote to Treasury (NT) on 27 January 2022 requesting the supplier and its director to be restricted from doing business with the State due to fraudulent misrepresentation when submitting invoices for payment in respect of State Funeral Services. The application was referred back by NT on 31 Mar 2022 on the basis of the restriction being on PPR of 2017. The department is currently implementing the recommendations made in the response by NT. o The Accounting Officer approved the Contract Management Policy on 11 April 2022, which sets out guidelines on contracts to enable effective delivery of goods, services and works in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. o The AG will follow up on the investigation and the implementation of the planned actions during the next audit.",

    "recommendation": "7.1 Background The PMTE was established in April 2006, as part of a long-term reform programme to provide improved property management services to client departments. National Treasury allocated a capitalisation amount of R450 million to initiate the process. From the start the challenge was to deal with the maintenance backlog of the immovable asset portfolio. This meant that all properties had to be recorded on a regularly updated national immovable asset register (IAR). It further meant that the immovable asset registers at municipal and provincial levels of government also had to be properly compiled and regularly updated. The main function of the PMTE is always referred to as the execution of all property management and maintenance related functions. The PMTE should do this on behalf of national government departments; this includes property rate and service related payments to municipalities. What is clear is that this more obvious iteration leaves the consistent task of coordinating the updating of municipal, provincial and national IARs in the shadows. This coordinating task requires a PMTE that has a footprint in every region and province of the country. That footprint is to be found in the eleven regional offices (ROs) that are headed by regional office managers reporting to the national DPWI. This is the network of offices within which the actual work of the PMTE, both the coordinating of the IARs and actual property management and maintenance related functions on behalf of government departments should take place. Even though it was established as early as 2006 as an internal entity of the department, it only started performing as an entity in 2014. Since then, its structure and functions have not been fully realised. To fully realise its function, the entity needs a full contingent of qualified, experienced property maintenance, information and communication technology (ICT), construction project, and contract management specialists. Such skilled personnel are hard to source and retain as they are absorbed by national and international property sector companies. The PMTE has therefore not been fully operational as a trading entity that can properly manage the government’s immovable asset register (IAR). It has since 2014 achieved some progress but struggles with consistent leadership that is required to overcome its human resource and financial management challenges. The full operationalisation is further facing the challenge of managing the property portfolio of government across eleven DPWI regional offices (ROs) headed by Regional Office Managers",

The allocation remained unchanged during the adjustment period.

The entity reported collecting an estimated R17.15 billion in revenue for the 2021/22 financial year. The final appropriation to the entity was R22.64 billion, which is an increase of R522.6 million from the R22.12 billion received in 2020/21. At the end of the 2021/22 financial year, the entity spent R19.75 billion (an under- expenditure of R2.89 billion or 12.8 per cent) for 2021/22.

The PMTE explained this under-expenditure as being due to the following: • Delays in the execution and finalisation of the projects. This was reported as being caused by poor performance by some of the contractors. There were also reported delays experienced due to deviation from the initially projected completion timeline of some construction projects. • Another reason posed in the report was the delay in finalizing some of the final accounts and the non or late submission of the final invoices by the contractors. • While the cost involved in such delays and deviations on construction projects are recoverable, the PMTE has to request approval from client departments before tenders are advertised, or when recommended bids are higher than the estimate and every time there is an increase in the cost of the project. • Delays in responses from client department are a major cause of underspending. Clients are expected to sign-off on their available allocations before the start of the financial year. Unfortunately, some clients only make the allocations available during the first quarter of the financial year. This leads to further delays and under- expenditure as projects cannot be placed on the procurement plan before approval of the budget. • The delay in the filling of the vacant funded positions have also contributed to under - spending.",

An amount of R9.68 million (R9 681 612) has already been recovered from the landlord as at year-end. • The PMTE entered into a contract with a service provider on 28 November 2013 to construct a Magistrate Court building at Mamelodi (WCS 044028). The contract was for a period of 18 months for construction and the contract value was R94.7 million (R94 742 592.85). o The construction of the Mamelodi Magistrate Court project has been significantly delayed and the expenditure paid to date exceed the initial contract amount. The practical completion date of the contract has been extended and the PMTE has been approving the contract extensions with adjustments to the contract value with the daily rate of R24 283,26 charged by the contractor. Based on the approved claims 4, 5, 8 and 9, the delays resulted from civil unrest, riots, strikes and lockouts. o This was a contravention of the JBCC 2000 Principal Building Agreement Clause 29.1, which stipulates that the contractor is entitled to a revision of the date of practical completion, but for which the contract value should not be adjusted if it pertains to delays related to civil unrest, riots or strikes.

These are reported as having resulted in actual expenditure exceeding budgeted expenditure. The difference was offset against the underspending as indicated above. Transformation The shortfall is attributable to the payment of TCC Chairpersons, which exceeded what was initially budgeted for. Skills and Capacity Development The surplus is attributable to accreditation visits not scheduled due to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in savings on travel. Research and Advisory The procurement of the Knowledge Management Hub was finalised towards the end of the financial year. The problem is that the Senior Manager and required staff positions remain vacant. This means that the Knowledge Hub may be finalised yet remains non-functional.

This equals an under expenditure of R272.0 million (or 3.3 percent) of the total appropriation. The department reported that the under expenditure occurred under all five main programmes. At the same time Programmes 1 to 5, reported that the underspending was mainly due to: Compensation of Employees (delays in filling of vacant posts, and non-implementation of projected annual salary adjustments); Goods and Services; Transfers and Subsidies; and Machinery and Equipment, to be discussed below. Spending was recorded as R7,531 billion which is 97.5 per cent of the adjusted budget of R7,724 billion. Programme 1: Administration received a final appropriation of R504.6 million and spent R416.5 million. This equates to under expenditure of R88.1 million or 17.5 per cent, by the end of the financial year as follows: • R32.0 million – Compensation of Employees, due to delays in filling vacant positions. • R52.0 million – Goods and Services mainly due to the nation-wide lockdown with the bulk of the activities being performed minimally, resulting in lower than projected expenditure. • R4.0 million – Machinery and Equipment due to delays in planned acquisition of assets resulting from unfilled vacant positions.

The investigation was finalised on 29 March 2019, confirmed the AGSA findings, and further identified additional irregularities with respect to each funeral. o The Department opened a case with the South African Police Service (SAPS) for civil recovery against the supplier as recommended by the Investigation Report. The case number is CAS 793/2020 opened at the Pretoria Central Police Station. The Investigation Report recommended disciplinary actions against the responsible officials. The matter was further referred to the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) on 18 September 2020. o An investigation by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) on the matter commenced in 2021, and indicated that the SIU will pursue a civil claim against the supplier. However, the SIU has not made the Report available to the Department. o The Communication noted that the Department approached the State Attorney to appoint legal counsel to assist the Department with disciplinary proceedings against the three officials still in the employ of the Department. The disciplinary proceedings are currently under way for the suspended Director-General and is being handled by The Presidency. The hearings for the other two officials implicated in the irregularity is being handled by the State Attorney. As at the date of this report, the disciplinary hearing had not been concluded against the officials. o A combined summons have been filed at the Gauteng High Court (Pretoria) for case number 20987/22, in a matter between Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure (Plaintiff) and the supplier on 01 April 2022. The summons is in relation to payments made by Department of Public Works and Infrastructure in excess of the agreed pricing schedule provided by the plaintiff during the tendering process stage by the supplier. This covers the two funerals in which the supplier was used to render services for the Mama Veronica Sobukwe funeral (R371 186) and the M Mtslali funeral (R124 315). The bulk amount of the outstanding financial loss to be recovered is being followed up by the SIU. The Accounting Officer wrote to Treasury (NT) on 27 January 2022 requesting the supplier and its director to be restricted from doing business with the State due to fraudulent misrepresentation when submitting invoices for payment in respect of State Funeral Services. The application was referred back by NT on 31 Mar 2022 on the basis of the restriction being on PPR of 2017. The department is currently implementing the recommendations made in the response by NT. o The Accounting Officer approved the Contract Management Policy on 11 April 2022, which sets out guidelines on contracts to enable effective delivery of goods, services and works in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. o The AG will follow up on the investigation and the implementation of the planned actions during the next audit.",

    "recommendation": "7.1 Background The PMTE was established in April 2006, as part of a long-term reform programme to provide improved property management services to client departments. National Treasury allocated a capitalisation amount of R450 million to initiate the process. From the start the challenge was to deal with the maintenance backlog of the immovable asset portfolio. This meant that all properties had to be recorded on a regularly updated national immovable asset register (IAR). It further meant that the immovable asset registers at municipal and provincial levels of government also had to be properly compiled and regularly updated. The main function of the PMTE is always referred to as the execution of all property management and maintenance related functions. The PMTE should do this on behalf of national government departments; this includes property rate and service related payments to municipalities. What is clear is that this more obvious iteration leaves the consistent task of coordinating the updating of municipal, provincial and national IARs in the shadows. This coordinating task requires a PMTE that has a footprint in every region and province of the country. That footprint is to be found in the eleven regional offices (ROs) that are headed by regional office managers reporting to the national DPWI. This is the network of offices within which the actual work of the PMTE, both the coordinating of the IARs and actual property management and maintenance related functions on behalf of government departments should take place. Even though it was established as early as 2006 as an internal entity of the department, it only started performing as an entity in 2014. Since then, its structure and functions have not been fully realised. To fully realise its function, the entity needs a full contingent of qualified, experienced property maintenance, information and communication technology (ICT), construction project, and contract management specialists. Such skilled personnel are hard to source and retain as they are absorbed by national and international property sector companies. The PMTE has therefore not been fully operational as a trading entity that can properly manage the government’s immovable asset register (IAR). It has since 2014 achieved some progress but struggles with consistent leadership that is required to overcome its human resource and financial management challenges. The full operationalisation is further facing the challenge of managing the property portfolio of government across eleven DPWI regional offices (ROs) headed by Regional Office Managers",

The allocation remained unchanged during the adjustment period.

The entity reported collecting an estimated R17.15 billion in revenue for the 2021/22 financial year. The final appropriation to the entity was R22.64 billion, which is an increase of R522.6 million from the R22.12 billion received in 2020/21. At the end of the 2021/22 financial year, the entity spent R19.75 billion (an under- expenditure of R2.89 billion or 12.8 per cent) for 2021/22.

The PMTE explained this under-expenditure as being due to the following: • Delays in the execution and finalisation of the projects. This was reported as being caused by poor performance by some of the contractors. There were also reported delays experienced due to deviation from the initially projected completion timeline of some construction projects. • Another reason posed in the report was the delay in finalizing some of the final accounts and the non or late submission of the final invoices by the contractors. • While the cost involved in such delays and deviations on construction projects are recoverable, the PMTE has to request approval from client departments before tenders are advertised, or when recommended bids are higher than the estimate and every time there is an increase in the cost of the project. • Delays in responses from client department are a major cause of underspending. Clients are expected to sign-off on their available allocations before the start of the financial year. Unfortunately, some clients only make the allocations available during the first quarter of the financial year. This leads to further delays and under- expenditure as projects cannot be placed on the procurement plan before approval of the budget. • The delay in the filling of the vacant funded positions have also contributed to under - spending.",

An amount of R9.68 million (R9 681 612) has already been recovered from the landlord as at year-end. • The PMTE entered into a contract with a service provider on 28 November 2013 to construct a Magistrate Court building at Mamelodi (WCS 044028). The contract was for a period of 18 months for construction and the contract value was R94.7 million (R94 742 592.85). o The construction of the Mamelodi Magistrate Court project has been significantly delayed and the expenditure paid to date exceed the initial contract amount. The practical completion date of the contract has been extended and the PMTE has been approving the contract extensions with adjustments to the contract value with the daily rate of R24 283,26 charged by the contractor. Based on the approved claims 4, 5, 8 and 9, the delays resulted from civil unrest, riots, strikes and lockouts. o This was a contravention of the JBCC 2000 Principal Building Agreement Clause 29.1, which stipulates that the contractor is entitled to a revision of the date of practical completion, but for which the contract value should not be adjusted if it pertains to delays related to civil unrest, riots or strikes.

These are reported as having resulted in actual expenditure exceeding budgeted expenditure. The difference was offset against the underspending as indicated above. Transformation The shortfall is attributable to the payment of TCC Chairpersons, which exceeded what was initially budgeted for. Skills and Capacity Development The surplus is attributable to accreditation visits not scheduled due to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in savings on travel. Research and Advisory The procurement of the Knowledge Management Hub was finalised towards the end of the financial year. The problem is that the Senior Manager and required staff positions remain vacant. This means that the Knowledge Hub may be finalised yet remains non-functional.

Explanations - Underspending and Variances Real Estate Management Services  The low spending was due to municipal services that the PMTE paid on behalf of the client departments. Although the function of payments for municipal services was devolved in 2006, the PMTE continued administering these accounts on behalf of the clients. The PMTE reported that this would be devolved in totality and had to be phased out but could not state a date when this would be completed.  The PMTE reported that this cost item was fully recoverable and that it was included for cash flow purposes.  Municipal Services expenditure was based on actual consumption by client departments and usually fluctuated due to factors such as electricity usage and load shedding as well as alternative energy solutions implemented by some client departments.  As with the previous cost item, the PMTE stated that this budget amount was reported as for cash flow projection purposes and was not to be treated as an underspending.  The unspent funds which were allocated for the rectification of illegally occupied properties",

Construction Project Management Services  In the fourth quarter performance report, the PMTE reported that it completed 59 out of the targeted 125 construction projects - this meant that by the end of the financial year it achieved only 47% of its predetermined target.  In engagements with this committee on its fourth quarter performance, the PMTE provided reasons such as construction projects across the country being stopped by local contractors demanding participation in projects; slow progress due to financial/cash flow difficulties of small and medium sized contractors; approval of funding by the client departments after awarding of projects; in some cases contractors requesting extension of project completion time due to late finalisation of internet infrastructure installation and access routes required for certain courts and legal offices by the Department of Justice and Correctional Services client; in other cases, extension of project completion time due to having to source another contractor; inclement weather; and in other cases, the inability of the client department availing the working space for the contractor etc.  In the meeting discussing its annual report, the delays reported in the quarterly performance report showed that the entity was unable to prevent these from negatively impacting on the PMTE‟s expenditure trends.  The PMTE explained that although the difference between the allocated budget and actual expenditure by the end of the financial year might look like an overspending, it was offset by underspending on the capital items; this was due to a reclassification of projects between capital and operational payments.  Delays in budget approvals led to under-expenditure as projects could not be placed on the PMTE procurement plan without client departments signing off on the allocated budgets and cost of projects. In cases where recommended bids were higher than the estimated costs and increased the cost of the projects, the PMTE had to request approval from the client departments before tenders were advertised. Delays in client responses was the major cause of under-expenditure. Clients were expected to sign-off on their available allocations before the start of the financial year, but some client department make allocations for construction projects available only during the first quarter of the financial year.  On-site defaulting contractors and other subcontractors that do not deliver in accordance to the projected project expenditure caused further delays.  Delays in the filling vacant funded positions also contributed to under-spending.",

Systems uptime – a crucial aspect for a company that relies on its online capabilities to allow contractors and clients to fulfil their responsibilities – reached 98% against a target of 95%.  The target for implementation of the action plan emanating from NSF discussions was also surpassed. This far-reaching list, agreed with the former Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, required action in key areas such as revisions to the RoC and procurement.  With the consistently high level of underspending on infrastructure budgets hampering activity in the sector, client capacitation continued to be prioritised during 2022/2023. The entity exceeded the planned number of client departments to be assisted by more than 30, bringing the total to 110.  Seventy-one clients were capacitated on contractor development programmes, double the targeted 36, while 377 grades one to six contractors were provided with development support.  Stakeholder management saw the entity travelling throughout the nine provinces to ensure awareness of its services to construction contractors. The provincial stakeholder liaison meeting initiative gained momentum and the CIDB to reach scores of public sector clients and grades 5 to 9 contractors. In this way, the sector was made aware of criteria for the RoC and the processes to be registered.  The entity engaged with clients to promote the Infrastructure Delivery Management System (IDMS) and discussed to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the flow of funds to projects. The B.U.I.L.D Programme received a prominent platform during these encounters, as the entity encouraged clients to comply in the interests of elevating the industry through skills, knowledge, and empowerment.  Our NSF for 2021 to 2023 remained focused on the issues most important to the industry, convening six meetings of its task teams, which were formed to delve more deeply into priority projects.  The entity‟s Empowerment and Recognition of Women in Construction (ERWIC) awards staged its third celebration of excellence in August 2022.

However, the Minister agreed that the objective was not to localise every product in the import basket but to move away from mainly exporting raw materials and importing most finished consumer goods and capital goods. There was a need to manufacture value-added goods and to innovate to ensure opportunities to increase wages and companies’ returns and to achieve greater levels of economic resilience. South Africa and other African countries should work towards manufacturing and exporting more value-added products and to be included into global value chains; hence, strategic localisation is necessary.

The Minister concurred, that in some instances excessive red tape may contribute to a delay in financial assistance for companies in distress. This was evident recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic when the DFIs initially advertised calling for companies affected by the pandemic to apply for financial assistance. The uptake had been minimal as a result of the archaic regulatory processes, which in the view of the Minister was not engineered to assist small and medium enterprises. When the recent unrest in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng occurred, the DTIC engaged the DFIs to relook at their internal regulatory requirements and re-engineer them to be more suitable for businesses to access funding. This new approach helped the DFIs to assist a number of businesses, saving jobs in the process.

A view was expressed that the B-BBEE policy was failing as it was only enriching a few and in no way contributing to the reduction of inequality and job creation. In his response to the statement that B- BBEE as a policy instrument was not achieving its objectives, he alluded to the fact that the current economic landscape did not represent a fully non-racial economy. He acknowledged that a country should not be held captive by its past, but he also recognised that the past had shaped the current and future policy development that would enable economic transformation and a more equitable society. He cautioned against labelling economic transformation as being inherently corrupt, acknowledging that such a process would be susceptible to it, noting the example of the PPE scandal. However, he further stated corruption was not only limited to B-BBEE transactions citing the example of Steinhoff International Holding N.V., which was not a B-BBEE company. He further highlighted the positive outcomes of the economic transformation agenda with workers at the Coca Cola Company, PepsiCo, and Pioneer Foods being part of a share-owner scheme.

The Minister informed the Committee that in light of 19 entities reporting to the DTIC and the volume of information at its disposal, it sought to provide an overview of key accomplishments of these entities. Reference to the Master Plans were to highlight the DTIC’s efforts to improve the implementation thereof to secure the intended outcomes of job creation and economic growth. Instead of just producing Master Plans, the objective should be to collaborate and establish a coordinating structure with organised business, labour and the regulators to achieve the economic objectives of government. Regarding the accomplishment of the Employee Share Ownership Plans, the Minister told the Committee that it was a direct outcome of the implementation of the 2018 amendments to the Competition Act (Act No. 89 of 1998) rather than a particular KPI of the DTIC. Accordingly, subsequent mergers and acquisitions encourage partnerships/collaborations with regular working South Africans in advancing the non-racial foundations of democracy, rather than seeking a partner that would own a certain percentage of the company.",

The Committee enquired whether the Minister could share details of his discussions around securing an extension and whether he was also looking to increase quotas against certain products in the process. The Minister informed the Committee that number of steps had been taken to promote and expand South Africa’s economic relations with the United States. This included bilateral engagements at various levels of government, as well as with business and labour. In addition, an African common position has been developed by African Trade Ministers on the future of AGOA. African leaders sought to consolidate and possibly expand the scope of AGOA. In terms of consolidation, they sought four key elements, namely: (i) Extension of AGOA for 10 years; (ii) Early renewal to boost investor confidence; (iii) Retention of all existing beneficiary countries; and (iv) Removal of trade restrictions from African products. In addition, they sought four areas of expansion of AGOA, namely: (i) Product scope to be extended and administrative rules to be reviewed; (ii) Beneficiary countries to be extended; (iii) Supportive measures to increase private sector investment; and (iv) Economic inclusion with focused efforts to bring in more small and medium enterprises, women and youth-led enterprises.",

According to a member of the Committee, mentioning particular accomplishments like the creation of seven Master Plans and the acquisition of employee share ownership by 120 000 workers might not accurately reflect the real impact of Master Plans on the broader economy, given the continued high rate of unemployment. The Minister informed the Committee that in light of 19 entities reporting to the DTIC and the volume of information at its disposal, it sought to provide an overview of key accomplishments of these entities. Reference to the Master Plans were to highlight the DTIC’s efforts to improve the implementation thereof to secure the intended outcomes of job creation and economic growth. Instead of just producing Master Plans, the objective should be to collaborate and establish a coordinating structure with organised business, labour and the regulators to achieve the economic objectives of government. Regarding the accomplishment of the Employee Share Ownership Plans, the Minister told the Committee that it was a direct outcome of the implementation of the 2018 amendments to the Competition Act (Act No. 89 of 1998) rather than a particular KPI of the DTIC. Accordingly, subsequent mergers and acquisitions encourage partnerships/collaborations with regular working South Africans in advancing the non-racial foundations of democracy, rather than seeking a partner that would own a certain percentage of the company.",

The Committee enquired whether the Minister could share details of his discussions around securing an extension and whether he was also looking to increase quotas against certain products in the process. The Minister informed the Committee that number of steps had been taken to promote and expand South Africa’s economic relations with the United States. This included bilateral engagements at various levels of government, as well as with business and labour. In addition, an African common position has been developed by African Trade Ministers on the future of AGOA. African leaders sought to consolidate and possibly expand the scope of AGOA. In terms of consolidation, they sought four key elements, namely: (i) Extension of AGOA for 10 years; (ii) Early renewal to boost investor confidence; (iii) Retention of all existing beneficiary countries; and (iv) Removal of trade restrictions from African products. In addition, they sought four areas of expansion of AGOA, namely: (i) Product scope to be extended and administrative rules to be reviewed; (ii) Beneficiary countries to be extended; (iii) Supportive measures to increase private sector investment; and (iv) Economic inclusion with focused efforts to bring in more small and medium enterprises, women and youth-led enterprises.",

However, South Africa is open to join the platform and address political challenges, such as the taxation issues faced by South African companies in Nigeria. This unexpected tax burden has resulted in a reluctance from South African companies to invest in Africa due to concerns over an unexpected tax burden. The DTIC informed the Committee that it is working to navigate these political complexities thereby fostering economic cooperation across the continent.",

By focusing on localising EV production, encouraging transformation in the automotive sector, and creating downstream opportunities, South Africa can position itself as a competitive player in the global EV industry, ensuring job creation, economic diversification, and sustainable growth. The Committee enquired whether the DTIC had considered any measures that would promote the development of downstream opportunities within the EV supply chain, thereby increasing local capabilities, ensuring that job creation is sustained, and promoting economic transformation within the industry. The DTIC informed the Committee that following a period of stakeholder engagements and research it had published an EV White Paper in December 2023 as a comprehensive roadmap for South Africa and a structure of a suite of policy interventions to support the automotive industry. The primary goal of this White Paper was to set a course to transition the automotive industry from primarily producing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles to a dual platform that includes EVs in the production and consumption mix, alongside ICE vehicles in South Africa by 2035. This vision was aligned with the foundational objectives outlined in the South African Automotive Masterplan, a strategic framework implemented from 2021 to shape the nation's automotive industry. It also aligned with the changing demand in export markets and South Africa’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gases. The White Paper had thus identified a two- pronged approach, with two focus areas, namely on developing (i) South African EV productive capacity through early action; and (ii) a local market for EVs.",

It noted potential issues where unspent funds due to cost-savings method were not aligned with the DTIC’s performance targets. The Committee enquired whether the DTIC accounted for cost-containment measures, such as unfilled posts, in its budget, and how it reconciled the savings with the impact on its performance targets. According to the DTIC, the scale and the unpredictability of the cuts, posed significant risks to its operational stability, and its ability to plan effectively. The Deputy Minister, Mr Z Godlimpi, asserted that austerity measures without financing the economy’s growth was counterproductive. He argued that cost- containment should not come at the expense of industrial policy, but rather strategic decisions should be made about where to invest for the future. Further, that sustaining fiscal health is dependent on a growing economy that requires investment that only strategic industrial policy can provide. The DTIC informed the Committee that it is currently engaging NT on the need to find a balance between funding consumption and investing in future economic growth. Through its engagement with the NT, it sought to establish a more predictable fiscal environment, which would be critical to mitigate the risk and ensure that the DTIC remains a “going concern”. Given the economic dampening effects of austerity measure, discussions with the NT have highlighted the need to balance cost-saving efforts with economic growth, while acknowledging the tension to ensure provision of social welfare. The DTIC was concerned whether the country can sustain its current spending pattern while aiming for economic growth.

The Committee enquired whether the DTIC had any engagement with NT and the DPSA regarding unfilled posts.

The Committee also enquired whether the DTIC should not consider removing these posts from its establishment to avoid audit queries and what has happened to the funds and programmes affected by these vacancies. The DTIC responded that it was concerned whether the country could sustain its current spending pattern while aiming for economic growth. Currently, fiscal policy is about trimming the budget, but it should also focus on reallocate funds strategically towards investment that can drive long term growth, particularly in infrastructure, human capital and innovation.

This hinders their ability to deliver services efficiently, but also impacts on their ability to innovate and keep pace with evolving needs and global standards. The Committee enquired whether the DTIC had any plans that would ensure the sustainability of these entities and whether consideration should be given to commercialisation of some of their activities to ensure their sustainability. The Minister in his response acknowledged the concerns of the Committee. He informed the Committee that these matters were being closely examined, particularly within the context of broader economic functions and standards. This included assessing their roles and responsibilities within a wider framework of economic governance. He further expounded that there is a need for recapitalisation and alternative financing mechanisms for several entities, stressing that some may benefit from user-driven funding through fees. However, he was of the view that implementing such a fee would require careful consideration to avoid pricing users out of the market while ensuring the sustainability of these entities. The objective would be to address capacity challenges by engaging the market without making entities’ services unaffordable or unsustainable. The Minister further stated the importance of providing greater clarity and efficiency in the work of entities, such as the Competition Tribunal, to expedite decision-making processes. This would allow the private sector and users to contribute through fees or alternative financing mechanisms. This approach, according to the Minister, would be in line with international norms and best practices.",

Currently, it appeared that these entities were being treated with a “compliance mindset” by the DTIC, rather than recognising them as critical vehicles to ensure/foster a fair, equitable and consumer-friendly marketplace. Furthermore, it expressed a view that proceeds of the National Lottery should also be utilised to support the public good. Currently, government is considering issuing a fourth operator licence to conduct the National Lottery. The Committee enquired what measures were being considered by the DTIC to ensure sufficient funding for these institutions responsible for consumer protection to enable them to not merely meet their compliance obligations. Furthermore, in issuing the fourth operator licence, whether government should not consider allocating a 20 per cent share to government. Through these mechanisms, government could consider recapitalising the NEF and ring-fencing funds for consumer protection agencies. This could significantly enhance both economic empowerment and consumer protection, which are essential for long-term socio- economic development in South Africa. The Minister was of the view that the proposal to utilise proceeds of the National Lottery for the public good should be given consideration, particularly to fund entities like the NCC and the NCR. He informed the Committee that the idea of leveraging the resources of well-endowed entities to build the capacity of others is currently under discussion within the DTIC group., which is part of the wall-to-wall approach. This would require a more integrated view of resources across different entities ensuring that the financial masses/resources of one institution could be used to build the capacity of another.

By focusing on localising EV production, encouraging transformation in the automotive sector, and creating downstream opportunities, South Africa can position itself as a competitive player in the global EV industry, ensuring job creation, economic diversification, and sustainable growth. The Committee enquired whether the DTIC had considered any measures that would promote the development of downstream opportunities within the EV supply chain, thereby increasing local capabilities, ensuring that job creation is sustained, and promoting economic transformation within the industry. The DTIC informed the Committee that following a period of stakeholder engagements and research it had published an EV White Paper in December 2023 as a comprehensive roadmap for South Africa and a structure of a suite of policy interventions to support the automotive industry. The primary goal of this White Paper was to set a course to transition the automotive industry from primarily producing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles to a dual platform that includes EVs in the production and consumption mix, alongside ICE vehicles in South Africa by 2035. This vision was aligned with the foundational objectives outlined in the South African Automotive Masterplan, a strategic framework implemented from 2021 to shape the nation's automotive industry. It also aligned with the changing demand in export markets and South Africa’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gases. The White Paper had thus identified a two- pronged approach, with two focus areas, namely on developing (i) South African EV productive capacity through early action; and (ii) a local market for EVs.",

It noted potential issues where unspent funds due to cost-savings method were not aligned with the DTIC’s performance targets. The Committee enquired whether the DTIC accounted for cost-containment measures, such as unfilled posts, in its budget, and how it reconciled the savings with the impact on its performance targets. According to the DTIC, the scale and the unpredictability of the cuts, posed significant risks to its operational stability, and its ability to plan effectively. The Deputy Minister, Mr Z Godlimpi, asserted that austerity measures without financing the economy’s growth was counterproductive. He argued that cost- containment should not come at the expense of industrial policy, but rather strategic decisions should be made about where to invest for the future. Further, that sustaining fiscal health is dependent on a growing economy that requires investment that only strategic industrial policy can provide. The DTIC informed the Committee that it is currently engaging NT on the need to find a balance between funding consumption and investing in future economic growth. Through its engagement with the NT, it sought to establish a more predictable fiscal environment, which would be critical to mitigate the risk and ensure that the DTIC remains a “going concern”. Given the economic dampening effects of austerity measure, discussions with the NT have highlighted the need to balance cost-saving efforts with economic growth, while acknowledging the tension to ensure provision of social welfare. The DTIC was concerned whether the country can sustain its current spending pattern while aiming for economic growth.

This hinders their ability to deliver services efficiently, but also impacts on their ability to innovate and keep pace with evolving needs and global standards. The Committee enquired whether the DTIC had any plans that would ensure the sustainability of these entities and whether consideration should be given to commercialisation of some of their activities to ensure their sustainability. The Minister in his response acknowledged the concerns of the Committee. He informed the Committee that these matters were being closely examined, particularly within the context of broader economic functions and standards. This included assessing their roles and responsibilities within a wider framework of economic governance. He further expounded that there is a need for recapitalisation and alternative financing mechanisms for several entities, stressing that some may benefit from user-driven funding through fees. However, he was of the view that implementing such a fee would require careful consideration to avoid pricing users out of the market while ensuring the sustainability of these entities. The objective would be to address capacity challenges by engaging the market without making entities’ services unaffordable or unsustainable. The Minister further stated the importance of providing greater clarity and efficiency in the work of entities, such as the Competition Tribunal, to expedite decision-making processes. This would allow the private sector and users to contribute through fees or alternative financing mechanisms.

Currently, it appeared that these entities were being treated with a “compliance mindset” by the DTIC, rather than recognising them as critical vehicles to ensure/foster a fair, equitable and consumer-friendly marketplace. Furthermore, it expressed a view that proceeds of the National Lottery should also be utilised to support the public good. Currently, government is considering issuing a fourth operator licence to conduct the National Lottery. The Committee enquired what measures were being considered by the DTIC to ensure sufficient funding for these institutions responsible for consumer protection to enable them to not merely meet their compliance obligations. Furthermore, in issuing the fourth operator licence, whether government should not consider allocating a 20 per cent share to government. Through these mechanisms, government could consider recapitalising the NEF and ring-fencing funds for consumer protection agencies. This could significantly enhance both economic empowerment and consumer protection, which are essential for long-term socio- economic development in South Africa. The Minister was of the view that the proposal to utilise proceeds of the National Lottery for the public good should be given consideration, particularly to fund entities like the NCC and the NCR. He informed the Committee that the idea of leveraging the resources of well-endowed entities to build the capacity of others is currently under discussion within the DTIC group., which is part of the wall-to-wall approach. This would require a more integrated view of resources across different entities ensuring that the financial masses/resources of one institution could be used to build the capacity of another.

The Committee was of the view that, given South Africa‘s unemployment crisis, short-term job opportunities may not significantly contribute to meaningful economic transformation or long-term poverty alleviation. Therefore, a more strategic focus on sustainable, long-term employment is required. The Committee enquired whether the DTIC has specific targets for creating long-term, decent jobs beyond temporary job opportunities. If so, what progress has been made toward achieving these, and how does it measure the sustainability and quality of the employment created through its programmes. The Director- General informed the Committee that the creation of jobs was dependent on companies‘ ability to generate employment through economic growth. The DTIC would continue to negotiate with companies to encourage the creation of additional jobs. Greater emphasis would also be placed on ‗no retrenchment‘ conditions during the merger filings.",

In addition, it attributed this progress to the implementation of prior audit recommendations and improved internal controls at certain entities.

The AGSA informed the Committee that its assessments are guided by a risk-based methodology, focusing on sites with high disbursement levels or those that previously showed weaknesses. The selection was therefore not random but designed to test whether control environments function effectively where financial exposure was greatest. Furthermore, the AGSA acknowledged the concern that only well-maintained industrial parks had been presented and confirmed that the DTIC was aware of uneven performance across different parks. The DTIC has directed provincial counterparts to develop turnaround plans for underperforming SEZs and industrial parks and to strengthen maintenance and infrastructure development.",

The Committee enquired whether the DTIC should reconsider whether a centralised Transformation Fund should be established, and should rather prioritise the governance and data-driven monitoring of existing funding streams, as well as efficiency improvements to maximise the impact of these funds. The Deputy Minister acknowledged that the Transformation Fund concept has been refined and several design weaknesses identified in the original proposal were under review.

    "recommendation": "6.43 Standardised Accounting and Financial Management: A standardised accounting and financial management system is important to prevent anomalies across the DTIC‘s entities. The lack of standardisation undermines reporting as well as audit reliability across the entities thereby increasing the risk of irregular or fruitless and wasteful expenditure. The Committee enquired whether there was a uniform accounting and financial management framework prescribed by National Treasury being applied and monitored by the AGSA to ensure consistency and prevent anomalies across all entities reporting to the DTIC. The Director- General informed the Committee that there are legislated reporting standards for the public sector. The public sector is governed by the financial reporting standards developed by the Accounting Standards Board, namely: the GRAP, the International Financial Reporting Standards for schedule 2 entities, and Modified Cash Standard to the department. National Treasury has already issued the Irregular and Fruitless and Wasteful Expenditure framework for the public sector. The AGSA audits were conducted against these standards.",
